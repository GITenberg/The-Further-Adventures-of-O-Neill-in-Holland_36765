<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small>WHERE DID O&rsquo;NEILL&rsquo;S DUTCH COME FROM?</small></h2>


<p>We had all heard something of Jack O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s
adventures in Holland; and the members of our
informal little club in Trinity College Dublin were
positively thirsting for fresh details. There must
be much more to tell, we felt sure: and we had
a multitude of questions to ask.</p>

<p>Now the odd thing about O&rsquo;Neill was that he
didn&rsquo;t like to be interrogated; he preferred to tell his
story straight through in his own way. He had evidently
studied hard at the Dutch language, but
without the least regard for system: and it was clear
that he had been by no means careful in the choice
of text books. Indeed, he seemed to be rather sensitive
on this point, no doubt regretting that, in the
ardour of his early enthusiasm, he had just taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the first grammar and exercise-book he could lay
his hands upon, without consulting anybody. It
was that curious plan of doing everything by
himself that doubtless led him into the initial
mistake, that of trying to get any sense out of
&ldquo;Boyton and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Brandnetel</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GREAT WORK.</div>

<p>Apparently he had kept that &ldquo;literary find&rdquo;
by him for reference, and for digging stray
idioms and rules out of, while he added more
modern volumes to his working stock. This would
account for his glibness in rattling off out-of-the-way
phrases, and for that rich bizarre flavour
which his simplest Dutch utterance undoubtedly had.</p>

<p>But we didn&rsquo;t know the worst.</p>

<p>Intentionally vague though he was in talking
about his authorities, we ran him to earth (so
to speak) at last in the matter of &ldquo;Boyton and
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Brandnetel</span>&rdquo;; and had a happy evening.</p>

<p>That book was all O&rsquo;Neill told us, and more.
Printed on paper that seemed a cross between
canvas and blot-sheet, it bore the date 1805. It
was very Frenchified, and the English puzzled us
extremely. Here is the Preface&mdash;or a part of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following WORK was, originally, compiled
by William Boyton. After passing <strong>five Editions</strong>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a Sixth appeared <strong>partly enlarged, and
partly improved</strong>, by <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jac. Brandnetel</span>. This
last Edition was published, at the Hague, in the
Year, 1751.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CIVILIZED LADY.</div>

<p>The several particles, of Speech, are arranged by
the usual Order; and Declare with precision; every
rule being followed, with practical exercise. This
Mode, of teaching, being already <strong>appreciated</strong>;
it will not be deemed Essential; nor do we, point
out, the utility of it. As to Syntax; it is fully treated:
whilst, <strong>last not least</strong>, cares have been exercised,
to unite ease with simplicity, accuracy with
idiom, and animate the <strong>Learner</strong>. It aims at
the pupil of <strong>High-Life</strong>, and to acquire the
Polish of the <strong>civilized Lady</strong>.</p>

<p class="r4">THE HAGUE, 1805.<br /></p></div>

<p>This brilliant introduction raised our expectations
to fever heat. We had never encountered
such an army of commas before; and as for the
English&mdash;!</p>

<p><strong>Anything</strong>, evidently, might be met with
inside the covers of William Boyton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Work&rsquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOYTON ANIMATES THE LEARNER.</div>

<p>The best of it, of course, was its extraordinary
politeness. Every other question was prefixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verschoon my</span>&rdquo;, and went on something like this:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zoudt gij zoo goed willen zijn mij toe te staan...</span>&rdquo;.
Then there were some plain and unornamental
phrases such as &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Men weet nooit hoe een koe
eenen haas vangt</span>&rdquo;.&mdash;This was labelled &lsquo;proverbial
expression&rsquo;, and was translated, happily
enough, by &ldquo;The unexpected often occurs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik heb er het land aan je</span>&rdquo; was rendered
mysteriously: &ldquo;I have an objection&rdquo;, &ldquo;I cannot
agree&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That was puzzling enough, and delightfully vague!
But for all that found the phrase doubly underlined
by O&rsquo;Neill and marked by him as &lsquo;useful
for general conversation&rsquo;.&mdash;</p>
<hr class="l2"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small>SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPENDIOUS<br />
GUIDE TO THE DUTCH LANGUAGE.</small></h2>


<p>There was something good on every page, as
might be expected from the very preface. And,
withal, there was a steady process of boasting
about its own merits that was most refreshing in
the barren realm of grammar.</p>

<p>With mock modesty it dubbed itself on the title
page, &ldquo;The Compendious Guide,&rdquo; and followed
this up with another title &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Korte Wegwijzer tot
de nederduitsche taal</i>.&rdquo; The whole compilation
was evidently the work of several generations of
literary gentlemen, who aimed at the &lsquo;Polish of
the Civilized Lady&rsquo; in quite different ways, but
whose united efforts certainly made &lsquo;The Work&rsquo;
remarkably incoherent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">POLITE DIALOGUES.</div>

<p>We all quizzed O&rsquo;Neill unmercifully about the
Civilized Lady, and read some dialogues with immense
satisfaction. So uproarious, indeed, did the
fun become at last, that our neighbours on the
stair came trooping in. Three of them were Cape-students,
hard-working medicals, whom we never
heard speaking Dutch, though we were well
aware they must have known it. Like the others,
they insisted on a full explanation of the tumult,
and we showed them &ldquo;Boyton&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t mind
so much about the Civilized Lady; but when they
turned to the Polite Dialogues at the end, a kind
of shudder seemed to pass through them, as if
they had got an electric shock&mdash;till finally they
dropped the book and screamed with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! that&rsquo;s nothing so very odd&rdquo;, said O&rsquo;Neill,
looking hurt. &ldquo;I have often used lots of those
phrases.&rdquo; Picking up the dishevelled leaves from
the floor, he ran his eye down a page or two and said:
&ldquo;Yes, of course. These things are all right: A bit
stiff and bookish, perhaps; but correct, quite correct.
You fellows needn&rsquo;t be so excited over nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read us some!&rdquo; clamoured the men from the
Cape. &ldquo;Read us some of the dialogues you imitated.
Go on! Read!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO BUY A CASTOR.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, &ldquo;almost any one of these
conversations about common things is good enough.
Here, for instance.&rdquo; And he took the book in
his hand and walked about the room, giving us
first the English&mdash;then the Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That conversation,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;must

<p>&ldquo;Hm&rdquo;&mdash;replied Jack doubtfully.</p>

out of your head. That stuff&rsquo;s never in any book.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOT MURDERED?</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the hasty reply; &ldquo;I see this isn&rsquo;t

<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;, said O&rsquo;Neill; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a reminder about a
neat phrase I picked up from my landlady. Did
I never tell you?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well. When my cousin came over, you know,
on his way to Germany, he stayed with me a
couple of days. He&rsquo;s very athletic&mdash;a fine wiry,
muscular young fellow, lithe as a willow, as you
are aware. So I wasn&rsquo;t astonished at overhearing
the landlady and a crony of hers discussing him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
They used a rumble of unintelligible words about
Terence, as he passed the two of them on the
stairs with the slightest of nods, and mounted
three steps at a time, whistling as he went.
There was no mistake about their referring to
him; and amid the chaos of sounds I caught the
words <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">eng</i> and <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">engert</i>.</p>

<p>Curious to know how Terence&rsquo;s agility, or perhaps
his swarthy complexion, had affected them, I
turned up these terms of admiration in my dictionary;
and found <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">eng</i>, &lsquo;thin&rsquo;, &lsquo;narrow&rsquo;. The longer word
wasn&rsquo;t there. But on the whole it seemed safe
to conclude from <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">eng</i> meaning &lsquo;narrow&rsquo;, that <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">engert</i>
would work out something like &ldquo;fine strapping
fellow and in excellent training&rdquo;. If that was it,
my landlady had hit the nail on the head. For
Terence had just been carrying all before him at
the last Trinity sports.</p>

<p>Her admiring criticism I duly entered in my
notes and kept for use.</p>

<p>Some days after Terence had left, the landlady
was praising her son&rsquo;s cleverness to me;
and to please her I just said that he was a
wonderful boy. &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mirakel van een jongen</span>&rsquo; was
the expression I employed; and I was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
proud of it. But she didn&rsquo;t seem appreciative of
my effort, so I fell back on her own idiom.
Fortunately the lad was quite slender, and I could
dwell with satisfaction on the suitability of my
new word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hij is zoo eng</span>&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja juffrouw hij is
een engert!&mdash;een echte engert!!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She received my encomium on her boy with
speechless indignation, and rose and left the
room. You can&rsquo;t be too careful&rdquo;, added O&rsquo;Neill
thoughtfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">BETAALD ZETTEN.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said one of the students. &ldquo;I prefer your
own notes even to Boyton. Haven&rsquo;t you some more?
Ah, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he enquired, turning to some
pencillings inside the back. &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dat zou je wel
willen</i>&rdquo;, he read aloud, &ldquo;&lsquo;signification doubtful!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s one marked &lsquo;<em>commercial</em>&rsquo;: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
consider the transaction as settled&rsquo;: Dutch apparently
something like, &lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dat zal ik u betaald zetten</i>&rsquo;.
Here&rsquo;s another labelled, &lsquo;<em>not <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">deftig</span>, but very popular</em>&rsquo;:
&lsquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ben je niet goed snik?&rsquo;</i> Translation <em>seems</em> to be:
&lsquo;you&rsquo;re not quite able to follow my meaning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! No more? That&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I have plenty more,&rdquo; interposed O&rsquo;Neill; &ldquo;but
not here. And you want to read this Boyton volume.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">GEKT GIJ ER MEDE?</div>

<p>&ldquo;Let me finish the &lsquo;Dialogue between English
gentlemen&rsquo;, and you may have The Work.</p>

<p>The first Englishman says: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bid U, mijnheer;
laat mij geene onheusheid begaan.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the other, the man who had been so
disappointed that his friend wasn&rsquo;t murdered,
answers politely: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik weet zeer wel welke <strong>eerbied</strong>
ik U schuldig ben.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up to this moment the two acquaintances seemed
to have got on fairly well together in spite of
some difficulties. Why two Englishmen when they
met in Paris about the year of grace 1805
should plunge into a complimentary dialogue
in Dutch, is not very clear. But that there
was a lurking feeling of antagonism in the <strong>gossip&rsquo;s</strong>
mind towards his compatriot, seems to be shown
by the remark that he now makes to wind up the
dialogue.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">DUIZENDMAAL VERSCHOONING, MEJUFFROUW!</div>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mejuffrouw</i>&nbsp;(!) <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik bid U duizendmaal om verschooning,
indien ik heden eenige onheusheid
omtrent U bega.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was final. The returned traveller hasn&rsquo;t a
word for himself, after he is called &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mejuffrouw</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind you, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued O&rsquo;Neill, holding
Boyton aloft like a trophy, &ldquo;if I <strong>did</strong> try to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
too prolonged conversations in that gracefully irrelevant
fashion, I had caught the trick of it from
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Brandnetel</span> himself. You have only to go on heaping
civilities on your wearisome talker&rsquo;s head, but take
care to call him, just once, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mejuffrouw</span>, and he&rsquo;ll
have to go. It&rsquo;s a neat way of saying Good-bye.
I never found the method to fail.</p>

<p>Some day I&rsquo;ll tell you how supremely effective
I found that unexpected little turn.</p>

<p>Why it&rsquo;s nearly as good as <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zanik nouw niet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small>HOW O&rsquo;NEILL LEARNED TO PRONOUNCE.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I never could quite understand,&rdquo; said Bart van
Dam, the big Cape giant, who had carried off
Boyton the week before, &ldquo;how O&rsquo;Neill managed, out
of such an extraordinary book, to pick up anything
of the pronunciation. For, as a matter of fact, he
<strong>does</strong> get quite close to some of the sounds; and
I can nearly always guess what he is trying to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he is talking about that interesting
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rotterdam</span> street, the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Boompjes</span>, he doesn&rsquo;t make
the first part rhyme with the English word loom,
and then add <strong>cheese</strong>, a thing I have heard
Britishers do who should have known better.
And actually, I have noticed he can distinguish
<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">goed</span>, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">groot</span>, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">goot</span>. That&rsquo;s promising.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOAT THAT RAN ROUND THE ROOF.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Some of my British friends at the Cape, even after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I graduated on English Literature and History, used
kindly to drop Dutch words into their conversation,
either to make it easy for me, or to keep
up my spirits, so to speak. Oh never a talk of
over five minutes, but little familiar terms like
<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">taal</span>, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zolder</span>, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">maar</span>, and so on, would begin to
be showered in, here and there. One of these
linguists had taken me into his own back garden,
(he was very fond of animals of all kinds and we
had gone out to inspect those he had) when he began
to explain the new improvements on his premises.</p>

<p>We got into a deep discussion on the right way
of draining a flat roof. &ldquo;Come here&rdquo;, said he, at last.
&ldquo;Look up there, and you&rsquo;ll see a <strong>goat of mine</strong>
running all round the open space!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goat!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;not unless lightning strikes
it. Firm as a rock! Now, isn&rsquo;t that the right sort
of <strong>goat to carry the water off</strong>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought he had said goot in Dutch!</p>

<p>Well now, Jack&rsquo;s beyond <strong>that</strong>. Who had been
coaching him?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAS A BROAD SOUND.</div>

<p>Naturally I turned up Boyton on pronunciation
the very first thing at home&mdash;and the mystery
was solved! I was amazed. Boyton excels in teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the sounds. Here is an extract or two from his</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">REMARKS ON THE DUTCH PRONUNCIATION.</p>

<p>There you have some of the Rules! They won&rsquo;t
lead you far wrong, in any case. Then, to crown
all, for fear the diligent reader wouldn&rsquo;t have
caught the point yet, Boyton goes back to his
favourite &ldquo;Doctrine of the Native.&rdquo; Here it is:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Editor places the learner on his guard against
receiving wrong references, and directs him to an Instructor,

<div class="sidenote">NATIVES.</div>

<p>Bravo, Boyton!</p>

<p>Three kinds of Natives he recommends the
beginner to consult. He has them arranged in a
sort of ascending scale&mdash;<strong>the Civilized, the
Intelligent and the Polite</strong>.</p>

<p>The two former classes will help you with the
pronunciation, or with <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het</span>.</p>

<p>From the latter you get idioms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<small>AN INTERLUDE AND AN APPLICATION.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;So our friend Jack had to ask always for the
sounds of the words. That would be right good
for him,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;and should have made his talk
intelligible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well of course it did,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;They always
understood the <strong>words</strong> I used. It was the
applications I made that hampered them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had great trouble with a chatty old gentleman
in the tram one morning going down to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Scheveningen</span>.
It was just seven&mdash;I was hurrying to
get an early dip, and he seemed bent on the
same errand.</p>


<p class="r2">Attracted by my blazer and towel he opened
conversation about sea-bathing, and then proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to discourse on the beauties of the landscape. He
seemed chilled by the poverty of my adjectives,
though I worked them vigorously.</p>

<div class="sidenote r2">A LOFTY CANOPY OF GREEN.</div>

<p class="r2">&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Deze weg vin je zeker wel mooi?</span>&rdquo; he said
at last, looking up at the arched green overhead.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of houd U niet van de natuur?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, zeker wel!</span>&rdquo; I hastened to assure him. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik
houd er erg van&mdash;Het is prachtig! Net een
tunnel van geboomte&mdash;van loofgroen.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r2">Then observing the pleasure my encomiums gave
him, I ventured on something a little more lofty
and poetic. My landlady had occasionally talked
about a &ldquo;canopy,&rdquo; which, so far as I had understood
her, I took to mean the vast cupola of hangings
over the old-fashioned bed in my lodging. She
used to say that the canopy was new and beautiful,
and needed constant dusting.</p>

<p>I had always agreed to this, but never dreamt
of hunting up a word that to all intents and purposes
seemed the same as in English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Indrukwekkend schoon</span>,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wij zitten,
als het ware, onder een canopey</span> (that was my
landlady&rsquo;s pronunciation) <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van bladeren.</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een kanapé, mijnheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja</span>,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">een verheven canopy, niet waar?</span></p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wij zeilen onder een groene canopy&mdash;verbazend</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnifique!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">BENT U EEN DICHTER?</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoe bedoelt U dat?</span>&rdquo; said the old gentleman
more and more puzzled, and determined to find
out my meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wij zitten hier, niet waar?</span>&rdquo; I began slowly;
then pointing to the roof of green over our heads,
I explained: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat alles vormt een prachtige canopy
boven ons heen. Zeker wel?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik geloof het niet</span>&rdquo;, said the chatty old gentleman.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De tram gelijkt ook niet op een kanapé;
of meent U dat?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De tram niet</span>,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">maar de boomen;
kijk; het gebladerte, het geboomte en de hooge dak
dat ze maken&mdash;dat alles zoo schitterend groen,
dat is, mijns bedunkens, niets dan een canopy,
uitgehangen zoo te spreken, over ons heen, in
uitgestrekte schoonheid.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r2">The old gentleman surely was a little dull. He
said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik begrijp niet goed wat u zegt. Waar is
de canapé? Of bedoelt U soms een badstoel&mdash;op
het strand?</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee</span>&rdquo;, I answered with a deprecating smile; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik
sprak maar poetisch. <strong>Verheven</strong></span>&rdquo;, I added with
a wave of my towel towards the greenery overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hé</span>,&rdquo; said he with friendly interest, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bent U
een dichter? Ik had U voor een schilder gehouden,&rdquo;
he explained with a glance at my blazer.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLOTURE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik&mdash;een dichter!</span>&rdquo; I returned modestly.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen; niet erg. Op een kleine schaal, misschien.</span>&rdquo;
<strong>On a small scale</strong>, I meant to say; but I must
have mangled the <strong>sch</strong> badly, for he didn&rsquo;t catch
the point, and I heard him mutter: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een sjaal!
een sjaal, EN een kanapé!!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja zeker, mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; I reasoned; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U ziet het
zelf voor U&mdash;daar onder de boomen&mdash;dat IS
hier een canopy&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Pardon</span>&rdquo;, he interrupted, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat is niet waar.
Dat zijn gewone houten banken,&rdquo; he persisted
argumentatively. &ldquo;En wat bedoelt U met een sjaal?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="r2">How pertinacious the old gentleman was! He
stuck to me like a leech. I couldn&rsquo;t shake him off;
and we were still far off the Kurhaus.</p>

<p>It was clearly a case for Boyton&rsquo;s conversational
method.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INTERLUDE AND AN APPLICATION.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mejuffrouw!</span>&rdquo; I said firmly, leaning towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
him, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik ken Uwe edelmoedigheid genoeg.
Maar</span>&rdquo;&mdash;and here I added two nice little local
idioms from the rich stores of my memory&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">maar&mdash;U
komt pas te kijken.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That told him he wasn&rsquo;t looking at the matter
in true philosophic perspective.</p>

<p>But this I followed up, in a more authoritative
way, with the assurance that I didn&rsquo;t at
all agree with him. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Waarempeltjes</span>,&rdquo; I whispered
with elaborate distinctness, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik heb het land aan je!</span>&rdquo;</p>


<p class="r2">The chatty old gentleman got off at the next
<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halte</span>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />

<small>THE &lsquo;COMPENDIOUS GUIDE&rsquo; ON DUTCH SYNTAX.</small></h2>


<p>Boyton&rsquo;s monograph on pronunciation is his
finest piece of work. He never quite reaches that
level elsewhere; and, if he is destined after a
hundred and fifty years to achieve a name, it had
better rest on his &lsquo;Doctrine of the Native&rsquo; than on
his Syntax.</p>

<p>So <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Dam</span> assured us, when our little party
met in his room the week before Christmas.</p>

<p>We had all been busy; but busy or not, the Cape
men found time to skim over Boyton&rsquo;s entertaining
paragraphs, as, indeed, we guessed, from the frequent
guffaws and readings that reached us from time
to time through the closed doors. To night we had
accepted an invitation to supper, before the holidays;
and we were to hear his views on O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
&lsquo;Guide, Philosopher and Friend&rsquo;, Boyton,&mdash;in
other words the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">&lsquo;Wegwijzer tot de nederduitsche
taal&rsquo;</i>. Long since Jack had, indeed, got other and
more modern manuals of Dutch, so that he was
supposed to look now with a certain contempt on
his former monitor: but the &ldquo;compendious guide&rdquo;
had laid the basis of his erudition, and he had
still a sneaking regard for its honest old pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO DEFINITE RULES.</div>

<p>What we wanted, indeed, was stories from Jack
himself: but we had exhausted the more dramatic
of these; and to get the fine aroma of the others&mdash;there
were still many others&mdash;we thought some
acquaintance with the compendium&rsquo;s syntax was
essential.</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Van Dam</span> had undertaken to put us up to
any niceties he had been struck with.</p>

<p>The first thing he told us was that Boyton had
no clear ideas of any sort, and never laid down
any definite rule. This lent him a certain diffidence
in regard to most points,&mdash;a diffidence which
in the case of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HET</span> became positive fright. At
the first mention of <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">de</span>, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het</span>, and an <strong>adjective</strong>,
he gives as much encouragement as he can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALL NOUNS TO WHICH <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HET</span> IS PREFIXED ARE NEUTER.</div>

<p>It is not much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>An insurmountable Difficulty for the Englischman is the
right use of the Particles, especially <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het</span>. Sufficient rules
cannot be given, E. g. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het mooie kind: eene sterke vrouw,
een zwart schip.</span></p>

<p><strong>This is certain, that all Nouns, to which
the Particles, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het</span>, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat</span>, or <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dit</span>, are added
are of the Neuter Gender; on this account,
the e final, in the Adjectives, when joined
with such words, is, generally, rejected.</strong></p>

<p>Even this rule admits of an exception. E. G. It is never
said: <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">een snel vogel: de groote paard</span>. But it
is correct to say, if the meaning admits it, <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">een groote
man</span>. (also <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">groot</span>.) A native may be consulted with
advantage.</p></div>


<p>When Boyton is labouring under strong emotion,
the effect is always to increase the number of
commas, colons, and other stops.</p>

<p>His agitation may also be traced in the way
he harks back to any fundamental rule that he
has already discussed ad nauseam.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">DEN</span> IS NOT A PURE NOMINATIVE.</div>

<p>It is quite pathetic to note how he urges on
his readers to reserve their dezen and dien and
den for the accusative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>It is good Dutch to say: <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik zag dien braven man
gisteren</span>, <cite>I saw that honest man yesterday;</cite> <strong>but it

<p>&ldquo;What I admire most,&rdquo; said <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Dam</span> handing
back The Work to O&rsquo;Neill, &ldquo;is the elasticity of
the rules. He says, for instance, that you can render
<strong>I know</strong> by <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik weet</span>, and on the whole he is
inclined to recommend that way of it. But he
never commits himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>It must be also admitted that
there are other authors of good standing
who employ the Subjunctive
form where we might expect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Indicative and who say</strong> <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">IK WETE</span>, <strong>I
know</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">IK GRAUW, IK KEF, EN IK KWEEL.</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s one of his rules!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there is no finality about
anything in these pages. O&rsquo;Neill, you were in
training for a poet when you took up this book.
I confess I should have liked to hear you going over
your fifteen classes of irregular verbs, on the
model (say) of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik grauw, ik kef en ik kweel</span>, or
even of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik krijsch, ik piep en ik lieg.</span></p>

<p>There is a rich profusion of tenses too in Boyton.
He needn&rsquo;t have apologized for being too simple
when he furnishes you with four ordinary optatives
and four future optatives.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOYTON TO THE RESCUE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;You may jest as you like about Boyton&rdquo;,
interrupted Jack; &ldquo;but I tell you it&rsquo;s a book that
has points. Do you know it once helped me to
save a lady&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save a lady&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; said the Professor and
the Philosopher in one breath. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll withdraw
all we&rsquo;ve said, if you&rsquo;ll prove to us, now, that
the &lsquo;Compendious Guide&rsquo; was ever the least good
to any human being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your adventure in your own way, O&rsquo;Neill,&rdquo;
a boyish voice chimed in; &ldquo;and shame the cynics.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>We all glared at the First-year&rsquo;s man&mdash;who
was making himself very much at home for a
lad of his tender years&mdash;but as he had nothing
more to say, we let him off with a look, and
turned to the lethargic story-teller.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<small>THE GRAMMATICAL CARESS.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;You saved life with that Boyton-Grammar of
yours, if I catch the drift of your last remark?&rdquo;
interposed the Professor magniloquently, as if he
were addressing a public meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I hazard the guess that Boyton on that
occasion was rather a weapon of offence than of
defence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;Offence is
more in Boyton&rsquo;s line. And he certainly did press
heavily, that day, on a butcher&rsquo;s boy. You remember
those <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">slagersjongens</span> that saunter about, in
white linen coats, with great protruding baskets
on their shoulders. They jostle and push wherever
they have a chance, and whirl round with their
cargoes of meat, so as to make you start. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
know the tribe. Well, Boyton proved an admirable
corrective to the insolence of one of these
imps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY CROWD.</div>

<p>It was a day there was a sort of festival in
the Hague.</p>

<p>From early in the afternoon there was a crush
everywhere. The <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">singels</span> and the main roads
through the Wood were filled with holiday-makers.
Soldiers were parading here and there. Everyone
was in the best of good humour; music in the
distance rose and fell on the air; flags fluttered
from the windows. Look where you might, there
were bright dresses, prancing horses, snorting motors,
and pedestrians of all descriptions.</p>

<p>I was one of the pedestrians.</p>

<p>I had been at my grammar in the morning;
and after a long spell in the house had stepped
over to Enderby&rsquo;s, and coaxed that lazy fellow
out for a stroll. It was perfect weather, and the
crowds were wonderfully well-behaved. We enjoyed
ourselves finely &lsquo;under the green-wood tree,&rsquo; till
we were brought to a stand-still in a dense mass
of humanity that was packed along the edge of
a canal, scarcely moving. A procession or something
had impeded the traffic some moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">INNOCENCE IN DANGER.</div>

<p>There was a knot of butchers&rsquo; boys right in front
of us. They were roughly shoving their neighbours
about, and seeing what mischief they could do.
Horse play, in fact. They didn&rsquo;t seem to fit into
Boyton&rsquo;s categories, either of &lsquo;Natives intelligent&rsquo;
or &lsquo;polite&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Presently one brawny scoundrel began to throw
stones at the occupants of a carriage that was slowly
passing by.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes!</p>

<p>There sat an old lady of eighty or ninety,
with soft white hair&mdash;the very picture of
fragility; opposite her was a nurse in dark uniform,
in charge of three dainty little children in pink
and white&mdash;mere babies of three or four&mdash;with
innocent blue eyes gazing all round them.
And, actually, that ruffianly <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knecht</span> was about
to bombard the group with whatever he had in
his hand!</p>

<p>Bang went a big mass of something&mdash;presumably
hard, from the rattle it made&mdash;against
the side of the carriage.</p>

<p>Happily he was a poor marksman, that rascally
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">slager</span>; for at that short range he ought to have
been able to demolish so fragile an old lady at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
first shot, or at the very least have put out one eye.</p>

<p>As it was, he only knocked off her bonnet.</p>

<p>Enraged, apparently, at his poor practice at a
practically stationary target so close at hand, he
picked up another half-brick and wheeled, to take
more deliberate aim.</p>

<p>The delicate old lady grew pale, and spasmodically
fumbled with her parasol to shield the children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEMESIS.</div>

<p>I thought her eye caught mine; and, seeing
there was no escape for her unless I interposed&mdash;no
one till now seemed to have noticed the
occurrence&mdash;I shouted, &ldquo;<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Stop, slager, stop</span>!&rdquo;
and whisked Boyton&rsquo;s learned pages right into
his face, taking care at the same moment to administer
a vigorous push to the long arm of the
lever conveniently made by his basket.</p>

<p>This forced him to revolve suddenly on his own
axis&mdash;beefsteak and all; and, as he spun round,
I accelerated his motion with a pat or two from
the &lsquo;<strong>compendium</strong>&rsquo;. It was all the work of an
instant, and executed just in time. The grammatical
caress foiled his aim completely, and he flung
his missile blindly in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>As I slipped unostentatiously into the crowd out
of the immediate neighbourhood of the discomfited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
marksman, I had the satisfaction of seeing the
dear old lady recover colour and smile. The babies
crowed with delight, and clapped their hands. They
thought it was a game got up for their special
benefit!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OUTCOME OF A REVOLUTION.</div>

<p>I raised my hat and retired, a warm glow of
self-approval in my breast, and on my lips an
involuntary quotation from Boyton: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De spraakkunst
is voor iedereen onmisbaar.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime the brickbat fell harmlessly on the
back of a policeman who, with hands tightly
clasped behind him, was studying a bed of scarlet
geraniums.</p>

<p>He never even turned, but only said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja</span>,&rdquo;
over his shoulder!</p>

<p>Two days after this adventure my eye caught
the following paragraph among the advertisements
in the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nieuwe Courant</span>:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="bbox"><p class="center">&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Stop, Slager, stop!</span>&rdquo;</p>

on the 31st Ultimo.</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>A GOSSIPY LETTER.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any more about that grammar-book,&rdquo;
I interposed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well in its way, but
it doesn&rsquo;t account for half Jack&rsquo;s adventures. Now
I can let you into a secret. Please don&rsquo;t look so
apprehensive, O&rsquo;Neill! As it happens, I had a
descriptive letter from Enderby just about the
time that Jack was making the most brilliant
progress with his Dutch vocabulary. It gave me
a vivid picture of what was going on in the Hague
when this linguist of ours got really started to
work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O&rsquo;NEILL AS A GUIDE.</div>

<p>Here are two of these long epistles. In the first
he tells me all about the MacNamaras&mdash;Jack&rsquo;s
cousins, you know&mdash;who came across from
Kilkenny, for a trip to Holland. They were at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oude Doelen</span> when he wrote, and our friend Jack
was posing as a great Dutch scholar and showing
them the sights.</p>

<p>
<span class="ri3">(From Enderby to Cuey-na-Gael)</span><br />
<span class="ri2" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen Hotel,</span><br />
<span class="ri1">The Hague.</span><br />
</p>

<p>My dear Cuey-na-Gael,</p>

<p class="i4">You would be amazed to see the confidence
with which O&rsquo;Neill acts as guide to the
MacNamaras.</p>

<p>MacNamara <span class="g" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</span> is mostly buried in museums,
or is on the hunt for archaeological papers, so
Kathleen and Terence are left on Jack&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>He has been everywhere with them, and has
evidently impressed them with his astounding
Dutch. To them it seems both correct and fluent.
They have only had three days of it as yet, and
haven&rsquo;t had time to find him out. Kathleen is as
haughty as ever; and I can see she chafes at being
obliged to submit to the direction of a mere boy,
as she regards Jack.</p>

<p>She was furious the day before yesterday, when
in passing through one of the back streets he asked
her if she had ever noticed what the Dutch
Government printed in front of the surgeries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEN MANGLED HERE.</div>

<p>She glanced up and, to her horror, read: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hier
mangelt men.</span>&rdquo; It was only a momentary shock;
she guessed soon enough what it meant; but it
gave her a turn all the same. Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t
a very finished kind of joke, but she needn&rsquo;t have
been quite so fierce about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cruel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;cruel and heartless!
Why even your dogmatic and intolerable chum, Mr.
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> wouldn&rsquo;t have been so harsh as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it was that little speech of hers that
suggested something to me. Was there ever anything
between her and <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>? They were at
the University about the same time, and it seems
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> was a great friend of the father,
who had him down to his place in the country
and showed him his manuscripts. But I believe
Kathleen couldn&rsquo;t stand him. They used always
to be arguing about the Suffragettes, and passed
for official enemies, in a way,&mdash;at least as uncompromising
leaders on opposite sides. She was fond of
saying that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> was a standing proof that
mere learning couldn&rsquo;t enlarge the mind. Once
in a private debate she referred to him as a
&ldquo;learned barbarian and a retrograde mediævalist.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOUN HUNGER.</div>

<p>She was called to order for it, of course; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
her apology didn&rsquo;t amount to much. She said she
wouldn&rsquo;t mind dropping the adjectives, but she
would stick to the nouns.</p>

<p>I believe <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> was quite content, however,
and congratulated his witty antagonist on
the fact that she would mellow with time.</p>

<p>We always thought in those days they were
sworn foes, and always would be. But I have a
dim idea there is now more friendly interest on both
sides. And, by the way, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> has been
carrying on brisk correspondence with O&rsquo;Neill,
especially since he heard the MacNamaras were
expected. He has offered his services, and those of
his motor, to all and sundry, especially if they
hail from Dublin: so I don&rsquo;t think he can be keeping
up very much of a grudge.</p>

<p>But I was going to tell you about Jack.</p>

<p>Lately I had noticed that his Dutch vocabulary
was growing very rich. He seemed to have quite
a hunger for nouns, and he used to ask the names
of everything. But I have no idea of what he was
up to. To day I&rsquo;ll find out and write you.</p>

<p>Much haste. Yours as ever.<br />
<span class="ri2">Enderby.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote r2" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">KINDSCH GEWORDEN.</div>

<p class="center r2">
(From Enderby to Cuey-na-Gael)</p>

<p>Dear Cuey,</p>

<p class="i4">I&rsquo;ve just been at the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen</span> Hotel&mdash;and
the Macs are gone! Very sudden I must
say. I suppose Kathleen has got tired of Holland;
or is she trying to avoid <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>?</p>

<p>You see MacNamara <span class="g" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mère</span> had written me a
friendly little note from Kilkenny, telling me
that the Doctor&mdash;as she always calls her husband&mdash;had
got a trifle absent-minded since his
deafness became troublesome, and would I look
him up occasionally during his stay in the Hague,
and give him some advice about the Rhine.</p>

<p>Well, when I reached <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vieux</span> <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen</span>, the birds
were flown. Gone at six o&rsquo;clock, I was told&mdash;the
three of them&mdash;to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cologne</span>! Quick work, I
thought; so I made a bee-line for O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s. He
surely would know about this sudden departure.</p>

<p>And in any case I wanted to get a glimpse of
his new mysterious studies.</p>

<p>Just fancy! The landlady met me at the door
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">A ROMMEL.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O Mijnheer, Mijnheer!</span>&rdquo; she exclaimed half-sobbing.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik vrees voor mijnheer O&rsquo;Neill. Hij studeert
te veel, of ik weet het niet&mdash;maar het is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
niet goed met hem. Ik geloof</span>&rdquo;, and here her voice
sank to a horrified whisper, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat hij een beetje
kindsch geworden is; want hij heeft speelgoed
gekocht, en hij maak overal zoo een rommel.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, juffrouw</span>,&rdquo; I strove to explain, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer
studeert natuurlijk.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she persisted, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh mijnheer! studeeren is
het niet. Hij ziet het scherm voor een kachel aan,
en verknoeit alles. Ik ben zoo bang, zoo benauwd!
Ik durf het huis niet uit, van Maandag af al!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather flustered by all this, I promised to call
the doctor if it were necessary; then climbed up
the stairs to O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>All was still. I knocked and entered. What a sight
met my eyes! Indeed it was enough to astonish
more experienced people than the landlady.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOME-MADE BERLITZ.</div>

<p>Neatly fastened on one side of the table was a
model train, engine and all. Beside it was a toy
house, with yard, garden, and stiff wooden trees.
Then there was a bit of a doll&rsquo;s room with a
kitchen stove. And verily to every one of these
articles there was a label affixed.</p>

<p>There sat the student, pen in hand, with a
dictionary and a gum-bottle at his elbow. Snippets of
paper littered his writing-desk and the floor around.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
His unfinished lunch (labelled too) looked down
reproachfully from a pile of books built on the table.</p>

<p>Over the gorgeous screen that hid the hearth
a conspicuous card was hung, bearing the mystic
inscription, &ldquo;What ought to be here&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kachel.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>No wonder the careful hospita was upset. It
would have been hard to say whether the apartment
was more like a museum or an auction room.</p>

<p>He glanced up with a sort of blush when I came
near; but raised his hand to enjoin silence, as
he found the word he was in search of, and wrote
it down.</p>

<p>Half expecting to see prices marked, I examined
some of the labels.</p>

<p>Nearly every thing had its Dutch name gummed
on to it, such as &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">spiegel lijst</span>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">behangsel</span>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schotel
of bakje</span>,&rsquo; and even on his sleeve &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">mouw van
mijn jas.</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he burst forth enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Doing Berlitz Dutch, you see! Self-taught, too!
Splendid plan. Three hundred words a day. I&rsquo;ll
have two thousand new nouns at my fingers&rsquo; ends
before the Macs are back from the Drachenfels.
Precious few things in the ordinary way of life,
I won&rsquo;t know then! Eh, what?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">SPOORWEG BEPALINGEN.</div>

<p>Then it dawned upon me he was getting up
vocabulary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nouns, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All nouns. That&rsquo;s
the secret. True basis of any language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a discovery of my own. If you know the
names of two or three thousand material things,
you can never be at a loss. But I stick in a proverb,
too, here and there, wherever it comes handy. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held up the sleeve of his dressing-gown on
which the candid announcement was made in bold
round-hand: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik heb het achter de mouw</span>&rdquo;, and
pointed to his bread-knife, which was tastefully
adorned with the words: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het mes op de keel zetten.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I saw.</p>

<p>Well; then he explained, and argued, and tried
to proselytize me. He was making hay while the
sun shone&mdash;which meant that he was preparing,
in the absence of Terence and Kathleen, for his
famous cycling-tour; getting on his armour, in fact.</p>

<p>In such spirits I had never seen him.</p>

<p>And, I must say, he made out a good case for
his method. It seems he had anticipated most of
the queries he might be obliged to put during his
travels. He had docketed every part of a railway
carriage, and even mastered all sorts of regulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from those of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Luxe-trein</span> to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Buurtverkeer</span>,
and from the yearly ticket to the humble <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">perronkaartje</span>.
It looked very thorough, and I understood
that he had treated his cycle the same way. But
I have grave doubts! I am the more confirmed in
my scepticism from what the landlady told me at the
door. After reassuring her on the score of O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s
health, I emphasised the fact that he was going on a
trip, and must practise Dutch by way of preparation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">GROOTE WATER-BAAS</span>.</div>

<p>That was worse than all, she thought; as <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer</span>
O&rsquo;Neill would certainly come to harm. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hij is
zoo veranderd! Hè! Het is zoo eng.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday he had asked her about the print of
a sea-fight that her little boy had put up in the
hall. She said it was <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">de Ruyter</span>; and began to
expatiate on that hero&rsquo;s achievements.</p>

<p>But he cut her short with: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een beroemde
man was hij zeker; misschien de grootste <cite>water-baas</cite>
van zijn tijd.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I explained that he probably meant <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zee-held;</i>
but not remembering the right term in time, had
taken one like it.</p>

<p>But the landlady could not be pacified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het doet mij huiveren te denken dat hij op
reis gaat!</span>&rdquo; she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO THOUSAND NEW WORDS.</div>

<p>I was not without my apprehensions either.
For he means to start out next week with two
thousand new words.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll probably find that such hastily acquired
information is not without its drawbacks.</p>

<p>But more again.<br />

<span class="ri3">Vale, vale.</span><br />
<span class="ri2">As ever yours,</span><br />
<span class="ri1">Phil Enderby.</span><br />
</p>

<p>P. S. The Macs are gone to Bonn, where
your uncle expects to find wonderful manuscripts.
Not much fun for Kathleen though! And Terence
will be bored to death. Why doesn&rsquo;t O&rsquo;Neill
bring him back to Holland and show him
Amsterdam and other towns?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<small>THE SURPRISES OF THE <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MAAS</span>.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; ejaculated O&rsquo;Neill irritably. &ldquo;What
an inveterate old gossip Enderby is, to be sure!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I got Terence back quite soon from
Bonn, where he had nothing to do; and I gave
him a splendid time sight-seeing in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Haarlem</span> and
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdam</span>. I&rsquo;ll tell you about that, another time.</p>

<p>But first about my run to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rotterdam</span>, where
I went one day for a little change I needed.</p>

<p>The landlady was a bit peevish and hysterical,
and, of course, very bothersome. She never quite
took to the Berlitz method, as I had improved it;
and she became grandmotherly to me from the
moment I made that slip about the <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">zee-held</i>.</p>

<p>The whole thing was getting on her nerves,
so I gave her a rest. Took a day off, in fact;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and went for a tour round the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rotterdam havens</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAIRYLAND.</div>

<p>I had some idea of recapitulating the old ground&mdash;the
first thousand words, you know&mdash;whilst
I should be steaming around the harbour. But
as soon as we pushed off from the wharf and
went skimming over the sun-lit <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maas</span>, the brilliant
and animated scene wiped the new vocabulary clean
out of my mind for the time-being; and I didn&rsquo;t
feel at all inclined to dig it out of my notes.</p>

<p>The marvellous colouring of everything held me
spell-bound. It was like fairyland. Our boat was
crowded, and a man on board pointed out the
sights. That was the only Dutch study I got that
day; for some one began to speak to me in English&mdash;an
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdammer</span>, as it appeared, who told
me that the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">grachten in Amsterdam</span> surpassed every
other spectacle the world had to show; and made
me promise to go and see them as soon as I could.</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought of the harbour we
were in; but he wasn&rsquo;t so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Meantime it had grown darker, and a steady,
cold, sea-fog drifted round us. It got dismally wet,
as well as gloomy; and the deck dripped with
clammy moisture. We were hardly moving, presently;
and our captain kept the steam whistle hard at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
work. The sight-seers were grievously disappointed;
and one fellow-victim informed me it would be
a good thing if we got near land anywhere, in
time to catch the last train.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">IK KRIJSCH, IK FLUIT EN IK GIL.</div>

<p>Horns kept booming around us, every few seconds;
perky little tugs and immense black hulls swept
by us at arm&rsquo;s length, piping or bellowing, according
to their temperament and ability.</p>

<p>The <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdammer</span> and I had gone to the prow,
to try and peer a little further into the dense
curling vapour, when a siren&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s
what you call the thing&mdash;gave such a sudden
blood-curdling yell at our very elbow, it seemed as if
we had trodden on the tail of the true and original Sea-serpent,
and that the reptile was shrieking in agony.</p>

<p>From that time on, we had sea-serpents every
other minute&mdash;whole swarms of them&mdash;infuriated,
inquisitive or resigned&mdash;soprano, alto, tenor;&mdash;all
whining, hooting and snorting; every one trying
to howl all the others down.</p>

<p>Excuse my referring to it, but it was the best
illustration I had yet got of Boyton&rsquo;s verbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik graauw, ik kef en ik kweel!</span>&rdquo; said one set of
voices. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik krijsch, ik fluit en ik gil!</span>&rdquo; answered
their rivals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">POLYPHEMUS AND THE SEA-SERPENT.</div>

<p>But the deep boom of new-comers swept the
earlier songsters out of the field: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik rammel, ik ratel
en ik scheur</span>&rdquo;. It was a regular chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik gier en ik piep</span>&rdquo;, squeaked the little tugs,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik fop en ik jok</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But the first musicians&mdash;the sentimental ones&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
be outdone. They were evidently turning
over their grammars very rapidly, to get a really
melancholy selection, for in another moment their
lugubrious snuffle pierced the fog like a knife:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik wee-ee-een; ik krijt; en ik hui-ui-ui-l-l!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was one long-drawn-out sob, that rose and
fell and rose again with such appalling and expressive
anguish that I could have imagined half
the Netherlands had turned into a gigantic sea-serpent,
and had bitten off its own tongue. So
human, too, was its tortured wail, that I instinctively
thought of Polyphemus having his eye
gouged out by Ulysses. The hero, you remember,
did it with a burning pine. One has a horrible
sympathy for Polyphemus, even though he is a
monster and mythical.</p>

<p>Happily our Polyphemus only gave two or three
of his prize yells. Then he seemed to settle into
sleep, away down the river somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CLOTHO.</div>

<p>The Amsterdam-man explained to me that in
his city the fog-horns were much more musical.</p>

<p>This thesis was warmly contested by a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rotterdammer</span>
who had overheard it, and who spoke of
the Capital with a distinct want of reverence.</p>

<p>The argument soon deviated into Dutch, and
I lost hold of it; but through a cloud of statistics
and history I observed that local patriotism on
both sides stood at fever heat.</p>

<p>By and by, the fog thinned a little; and we crept
along to a landing-stage, where the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdammer</span>
and I climbed on shore with alacrity. We lost
our way at first, and wandered about within earshot
of the siren-brood, whooping and calling and
taunting one another on the river; but my new-made
friend stumbled at last on some spot he was
acquainted with; and hastily giving me some directions,
went off to his train.</p>

<p>After the long Polyphemus-concert on the murky
river I wasn&rsquo;t in much humour for Dutch, but I
had to speak it at every corner to ask my way.</p>

<p>In an open thoroughfare&mdash;there were some
people about, but not many&mdash;near an archway,
I came upon Clotho.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLOOM AND MYSTERY.</div>

<p>Perhaps the Greek Mythology was running in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my head: but there she sat. Old beyond words, but
hale; wrapped up marvellously with head and jaws
swathed in dim flannel, she gazed, without moving,
on a table in front of her, spread with dried eels
and other occult delicacies. As I approached, to
enquire for the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kortste weg naar de electrische tram</span>&rsquo;,
she didn&rsquo;t move a muscle. Something about her made
me pause upon my step, and refrain from speech.</p>

<p>No movement.</p>

<p>But wait! One thickly muffled hand went out
to some obscure eatable, slowly grasped it, dipped
it in a sort of cup, then, still more slowly, brought
it to her lips.</p>

<p>Yes. She was alive; for she munched, calmly
and dispassionately.</p>

<p>The sight impressed me. It was like Fate; or
an ancient priestess performing mysterious rites.
Clotho would look like this, if Clotho would munch
instead of spin.</p>

<p>Meantime the inevitable butcher&rsquo;s boy had
joined me. Two of them, indeed, stood at my side,
curious to know what interested the <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vreemdeling</span>.</p>

<p>The old lady never winced under the scrutiny,
but put forth her hand again for another shell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT IS <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">TREK</span>?</div>

<p>There was a book-stall near, but nobody at it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as far as I could see. The whole street sounded
hollow; and everything dripped. It made me
shiver to look at the stone-pillars, oozy and moist,
with condensed sea-fog trickling down. The glaring
street-lamps hardly lit up the scene; but they
showed the damp. Polyphemus gave a distant
whoop, as if it were his last: and the Spectre
munched. She hadn&rsquo;t once looked up.</p>

<p>It all felt like a dream&mdash;except for the
butchers&rsquo; boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat doet ze&mdash;die oude mejuffrouw?</span>&rdquo; I
enquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ze zit te eten</span>,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Waarom zit ze te eten daar?</span>&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Om dat ze trek heeft!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A snigger went round the company. Evidently
that reply was of the nature of wit; and they
expected something sparkling from me in return.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> I couldn&rsquo;t sparkle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SOCRATIC DIALOGUE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Trek</span>&rdquo; was unknown to me. Strange, how you
can be bowled over by a simple word, if you&rsquo;ve
never heard it. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Trekken&mdash;trok&mdash;getrokken</span>, was
familiar. That meant &lsquo;to pull,&rsquo; &lsquo;draw,&rsquo; or &lsquo;wander&rsquo;.
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">&ldquo;Trekschuit&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;trekpot&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;trekvogel&rdquo;</span>; I
had them all labelled on my desk in the Hague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
But &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">trek</span>&rdquo; itself, what was that exactly? Provided
of course, the youth were grammatical,&mdash;which
I very much doubted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zij heeft getrokken</span>,&rdquo; however, when I tried
it, only raised new difficulties. <strong>What</strong> then did
she pull, and <strong>why</strong>?</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Trekvogel</span>&rsquo; was an alluring idea to follow up, in
a town where <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan Olieslagers</span>&rsquo; fame was universal:
but common sense forbade my pursuing that line far.</p>

<p>The defects of my home-made Berlitz became
painfully evident. It&rsquo;s humiliating, when you have
your 2000 new nouns at your fingers&rsquo; ends, and
hundreds of old ones; and yet can&rsquo;t understand
the first thing a <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knecht</span> says.</p>

<p>But the bystanders were growing impatient; so&mdash;to
withdraw gracefully&mdash;I enquired, &ldquo;wat
is <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">trek?&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>It was probably the best retort I could have
made. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, wat is het?</span>&rdquo; he soliloquised, evidently
puzzled, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik weet het niet. Maar ik heb altijd trek.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik ook</span>&rdquo;, said a smaller boy; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">in een boterham.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tongues were loosened on all sides. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee; in
een lekker stuk worst</span>,&rdquo; I heard one say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee; niet waar</span>&rdquo;; interrupted a brawny fellow
with a brick-red face; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zuurkool en spek.</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A COSY TALK.</div>

<p>I nipped the unprofitable discussion in the bud by
demanding, as I moved away: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maar wat <em>is</em> trek?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dat weet je wel</span>,&rdquo; said the first fellow, the wit.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Als je te veel eet.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, heelemaal niet</span>,&rdquo; jeered a late-comer.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kan je begrijpen! Maar als je <strong>niets</strong> eet, <strong>dan</strong>
heb je trek!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd cheered at this. He had evidently
the majority with him. High words followed; and
the controversy became general, as the protagonists
in this psychological debate found backers, and
swarmed away towards the centre of town.</p>

<p>I was left alone, and Clotho looked up.</p>

<p>She dipped a periwinkle in one of the weird
cups, and held it towards me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heeft Mijnheer trek?</span>&rdquo; Would I join in the
repast!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik? Duizendmaal verschooning!</span>&rdquo; I said, as I
quickened my pace in rapid retreat.</p>

<p>My confusion increased as I reflected that I had
probably been urging my late interlocutors to &ldquo;define
appetite&rdquo;&mdash;a thing even Aristotle could hardly do.
Naturally the populace broke into parties&mdash;Aristotelians
and Platonists (let us say), or into <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hoekschen

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAT.</div>

<p>In any case my confidence was shaken in my
improved, home-made Berlitz. It might be splendid
for travelling; but in ordinary life it didn&rsquo;t seem
to cover the ground.</p>

<p>On arriving at my lodgings I was met at the
door by the landlady&rsquo;s son. He was beaming.
Lately he had been working up his English, and
truly had made giant strides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Koot eeffening, Sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Koot eeffening!
Ai hef an little chat.&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>I wish to have a chat</strong>&rdquo;,
he <em>seemed</em> to mean.</p>

<p>It was an odd request for a trifling practice in
English; but I like to encourage merit, so I assured
him of my willingness to have a friendly talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. All right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you come
up stairs? We have a few minutes before supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Ai hef <strong>here</strong> an naiz little chat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, just so. Did you perhaps have a talk with
some one in English when I was away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but ai <em>hef</em> een chat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was bewildering; and as he seemed puzzled,
too, and always stuck to the same noun I investigated
more fully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk of a <em>chat!</em>&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dat is een praatje,
weet je wel?</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVIDENCES OF HUNGER.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, mijnheer, heus: het is waar. Geen praatje.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were half-way up the stairs now. &ldquo;Come
on&rdquo;, I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vayt&rdquo;, he replied, diving into some recess. &ldquo;Ai
vil let see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant he was back with something under
his coat. This he produced with the delighted
exclamation: &ldquo;ze little chat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a bedraggled kitten that he had discovered
wandering about in the fog and mewing piteously.
&ldquo;Vil you hef him? <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Anders, zegt moe, hij kan niet
blijven.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to your mother about the kitten,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;Kitten,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we call it&mdash;not chat.
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maar hoor eens, jongen, heeft het poesje trek?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O mijnheer, verbazend!</span>&rdquo; was the ecstatic reply;
and in another three minutes he had a saucer of
milk under the foundling&rsquo;s nose, and was watching
kitty&rsquo;s lapping operations with a joy as keen as
that of kitty herself.</p>

<p>I had got what I wanted without any philosophic
argument. There was the proof.</p>

<p><i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Trek</i> is <em>appetite</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<small>THE THUNDERSTORM.</small></h2>


<p>I must tell you about that great walk we took
from Leyden to Haarlem. That was just after
Terence came back from Germany, wearied with
waiting till his learned Dad would cease pottering
about the museums in Bonn.</p>

<p>He wrote to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span>; and urged
that youth use his influence with the University Librarian
to let Dr. MacNamara see the Irish manuscripts
he was so keen upon. Then, if you please, my
brave Terence thought his duties were over, as
far as helping his father was concerned. Taking
the next train for the Hague he turned up unexpectedly
at my lodgings.</p>

<p>That was at six in the morning, and he banged at
my bedroom door till I was awake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NORTH SEA COAST.</div>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to carry
you off on that famous bicycle tour of yours. Hurry
up with all those papers and preparations and
things,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll be round with my bike in no time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I shouted through the closed door,
&ldquo;you may come as soon as ever you like; but
there&rsquo;ll be no bicycle tour to-day. I&rsquo;m not nearly
ready yet. I&rsquo;ve all the nouns from T to Z to learn
yet; and it&rsquo;ll take me another week. Catch me
leaving this neighbourhood without those nouns!
No, my boy. But I&rsquo;ll take a tramp with you to
the seaside, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t wait for my explanations but pranced
off grumbling, and I didn&rsquo;t see him till noon. He
was then quite willing to fall in with my project
of a long walk&mdash;first by the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">strand</span> to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Noordwijk</span>,
then inland through the dunes, and so on to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Haarlem</span>.</p>

<p>We only got as far as <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Noordwijk</span> that evening.
After a heavy miserable trudge by the shore, and
mostly through loose sand, we were glad enough
to put up at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Huis-ter-Duin</span> for the night. The sunset,
magnificent though it was, could hardly banish
the deep sleepiness that seized us. Terence, who was
in better training than I, sat up smoking a while,
but I heard him go off to his room before I fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
over. All the music, laughter, and talk about the place,
never in the slightest degree disturbed our slumber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN EXQUISITE DAWN.</div>

<p>I slept like a log, and awoke early, with the
sound of the sea in my ears. It was a softly
modulated, gentle murmur that seemed to call me;
and when I looked out, the view was superb. Deep
blue, almost indigo in hue, and calm as oil, the
waves stood high on the sands. Every now and
then a long, knife-like billow would slowly rise up
for half-a-mile or so, poise itself for an instant,
and then fall with a mighty flap, like a wall of
slate. Away out towards the horizon the ocean
gleamed a fairy-like blue and opal; but close at
hand it had a deep, menacing tint that took your
breath away. And all the time those slatey ledges
of water kept languidly lifting themselves and
suddenly dropping, as if they were alive.</p>

<p>When I opened the window, a cool wind softly
stole in&mdash;like some subtle elixir. I looked at my
watch. It was half past four. Fired with the idea of
having a tramp by that mysterious light, I went
off and roused Terence&mdash;happily without terrifying
the other inmates of the hotel. He was willing
to make an early start if I could secure him
enough breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MORNING WALK.</div>

<p>This required some diplomacy. Suddenly encountering
a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knecht</i> prowling about and collecting boots,
I tried to communicate our plans to him, and
gain his sympathy. No idiom, however, that I
was acquainted with was equal to this strain:
so I had recourse to the language of gesture and
the display of coin. This at last induced him to
bring us part of his own modest breakfast&mdash;a
chunk of black bread and a hard-boiled egg&mdash;and
to let us out by the front door.</p>

<p>He kept our bags, however, and a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bankbiljet</span>,
to settle the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">rekening</span> provisionally, and as an evidence
of good faith. It was a fussy business getting him
to agree even to this, and in consequence I quite
forgot about my dictionary and &ldquo;walking-tour
notes&rdquo;&mdash;which were strapped up in the bag.</p>

<p>Indeed, I didn&rsquo;t notice the neglect till we were far
away from the hotel. But there was no Dutch needed
for a long time.</p>

<p>It was an exhilarating experience to go careering
along by that weird, threatening sea in the fresh
morning air. The scent of herbs and wild-flowers
on the dunes greeted us when we took a turn
inland: and the colours of everything around us
kept changing with incredible swiftness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BY THE SUMMER SEA.</div>

<p>At first we couldn&rsquo;t keep our eyes off the
mirror-like expanse of water. Its slate became steel-blue&mdash;the
steel-blue deepened into purple shading
off into amethyst, while the sky and the air all
about us grew rosy, then saffron, then silver.</p>

<p>Over and across the rolling hills we trudged,
our spirits rising every instant. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we
keep on till we got opposite <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Haarlem</span>, then strike off
east, do that city, and return by rail? Why not
indeed? <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Huis-ter-Duin</span> and its slippered <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">knecht</span> could
settle the matter of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">rekening</span> and the change,
by post; and we should make a day of it!</p>

<p>So we climbed up and down along the edge
of the grassy slopes, till the tide retired from the
sands a little. There we had a delightful hour,
along the firm damp shore. It grew sultry after a while;
yet it was only a quarter to eight. There would
be more heat yet! Alternately we tried the dunes
and the beach&mdash;the beach and the dunes&mdash;but
there was no shelter from the sun; and the
pleasant wind had died down. After an other couple
of hours&rsquo; toil through the hot, loose sand we decided
we had enough of the coast for the day, and
followed a kind of winding path inland. This was
a regular cart-track at first, and promised to lead us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to some thriving village where we could have a
rest. But it didn&rsquo;t. It twined round a score of
scattered potatoe plots, and then came to an abrupt
and ignominious end against a wire fence, on the
top of a hill. No doubt we ought to have gone
back and kept along the shore. But we were too
hungry to think of returning to the desolation we
had left. What we wanted was to see houses as soon
as possible&mdash;houses containing eatables and cool
rooms and chairs. Besides, we were as yet pretty
confident of our geographical whereabouts; accordingly
we pushed on for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Haarlem</span>&mdash;as we thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOST IN THE DUNES.</div>

<p>Well, it was a great mistake! The map makes
the dunes only a few miles broad at most, yet
we climbed up and down for hours, and couldn&rsquo;t
get clear of them.</p>

<p>Once we saw a fisherman at a distance and
we yelled to him. He answered &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">terug</span>&rdquo; very faintly,
and waved both arms. We hurried to meet him, but
not a trace of him was to be found. Though the heat
was intense, after a while shimmery haze began
to spread over the sky, and there came a sudden
change. It got dark and cold; and the storm that
had been threatening all day burst on us with fury.
In two or three minutes we were drenched. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was a marvellous display of sheet lightning so
curious and varied that for a while it diverted our
attention from our miserable plight, as we stumbled
on over soaked hillocks and sand. We had a good
hour of this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO FOOD FOR SALE.</div>

<p>In a dismal grove of non-descript-shrubs, we
at last stumbled upon a trifling shelter, just as the rain
was ceasing; and there we shivered like aspens,
till the truth dawned upon us that there was a
faint sound of human voices over the slope. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
we shouted. &ldquo;Relief at last&mdash;and a chance
of something to eat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stiff and dripping though we were, we positively
bounded over the sand hill.</p>

<p>Two or three small one-storied cottages came
soon into view. Rushing into the first&mdash;it looked
like a shop, and had the words <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">garen en band</i>
over the window&mdash;we demanded pointedly if
we could get food. The youngish woman who ambled
slowly to and fro behind the counter, said she had
no coffee or bread for us, but we could get these
things in Haarlem. There was a good restaurant
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen ei?</span>&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>No; not even an egg for sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ORDINARY BAKER.</div>

<p>Very disappointed we retired, still dripping,
and gloomier than ever; but as we left the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">winkel</span>
I espied a group of schoolchildren, with capes round
their heads, dancing along merrily hand in hand.
They were evidently coming from school. Such
bright blue eyes, such plump and rosy cheeks
suggested that food was plentiful wherever they
lived. There must be a butcher and a baker near,
I concluded; and by a happy inspiration I turned
back to the depressing <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">garen en band</i> shop, and
enquired where the local baker was to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Is er een baker hier?</span>&rdquo; I enquired politely of
the lethargic <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">juffrouw</span>.</p>

<p>She woke up immediately. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, zeker!</span>&rdquo; was
the prompt reply. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Net gisteren thuis gekomen!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was all right, of course. Why does he come
home and go away, I wondered. But, after all, that
was a small matter. He was at home now. A
peripatetic baker, perhaps, might be some very
special and clever artist in pies and tarts and rich
cake&mdash;and it was the humble, ordinary baker that
we were in search of. I stated this. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen banket
baker is noodig, juffrouw!</span>&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een gewonen
baker bedoel ik&mdash;een gewonen alledaagschen
baker. Bestaat er een hier?</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BROKEN SIESTA.</div>

<p>She had meantime summoned two young men
from a sort of den behind the shop, and now
communicated my wishes to them with an interest
and an animation that I hadn&rsquo;t expected. They led
us rapidly half a mile across fields, and then up
a little lane. The last few yards were done in
good record time, I should say.</p>

<p>This sympathetic promptitude we highly appreciated,
as we felt now more and more famished,
the nearer we approached provisions. We reached
the baker&rsquo;s house breathless, and were ushered
panting into a kind of waiting room. At least you
couldn&rsquo;t call it a shop exactly.</p>

<p>When the baker came into this apartment (by
the way it was a woman, that turned up&mdash;a portly
and middle-aged woman) we noticed that she was
rather dishevelled, as if just awakened from a much
needed siesta. I was sorry, but not surprised. Bakers
are often that way, you know. They bake during
the night, and sleep during the day. Thus they are
rather drowsy and cross, if you wake them up.
She looked both. There was a portentous frown
upon her brow; and really, she seemed somewhat
of the virago type. That made me doubly polite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Duizendmaal vergiffenis, banketbaker!</span>&rdquo; I apologised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with my best bow. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het spijt mij geweldig.&mdash;Maar
zult gij zoo goed willen zijn&mdash;?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WOU JE ETEN?</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja ja!</span>&rdquo; she interrupted impatiently; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Waar?
Heb je een rijtuig?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een rijtuig?</span>&rdquo; I exclaimed in bewilderment.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee. Ik heb geen rijtuig. Maar mag ik u beleefd
verzoeken of U zoo goed&mdash;.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, ja! Is er haast bij?</span>&rdquo; She broke in again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel zeker!</span>&rdquo; I replied courteously, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Veel haast.
Wij zijn verbazend hongerig.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was gone, and hadn&rsquo;t heard the last
remark. In a moment or two she reappeared, fully
dressed, tying the strings of her bonnet.</p>

<p>As I waited a second before repeating my request,
she grew most unreasonably irritable, and actually
stamped her foot, exclaiming disrespectfully:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gaauw nouw! gaauw een beetje.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja baker!</span>&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wilt gij zoo goed zijn,
twee boterhammetjes en twee glaasjes melk te
brengen?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped titivating herself at the mirror,
and turning round groaned in a voice of horror:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wou je eten?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ja,&rdquo; I contrived to put in, as politely as I
could; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">als U zoo goed wilt zijn.</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">BETAALD ZETTEN.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maar schaam jullie niet? bent jullie kinderen
dat je nouw om een boterham moet vragen?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was plain she was a good deal ruffled. Accordingly
to appease and conciliate her I smiled again,
and said deferentially: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het heeft niets te beduiden.
Wij moeten een heel klein boterhammetje gebruiken.
Een sneedje brood zonder iets&mdash;dat is
ook goed.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed stunned by this harmless announcement;
and I deemed it prudent to offer her a
bribe of some kind. The simplest plan was to promise
to pay her well for any trifle we took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het is een kleinigheid</span>,&rdquo; I told her&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">niets
dan een kleinigheid. Maar ik zal het je betaald
zetten.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That loosened her tongue. Her natural fluency
asserted itself and appeared to fine advantage. But
she was so needlessly excited that I knew there
must be a misunderstanding somewhere. Accordingly
to remove all haziness I just indicated that
she had failed to grasp my meaning. The idiom
for this I fortunately recollected. <cite>You don&rsquo;t quite
follow</cite> was one of those choice specimens of local
colour that, by frequent repetition, I had thoroughly
imprinted on my memory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">YOU DON&rsquo;T QUITE FOLLOW.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Duizendmaal verschooning</span>,&rdquo; I said heartily,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bent U soms niet goed snik?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect of this well meant apology was electrical.
The woman really became very rude. She
got pale and grabbed at a chair. As we withdrew
unostentatiously, we noticed her springing
in our direction and talking. It was the most
fluent talk I had yet heard in Dutch. She did not
hesitate one instant for gender, number, or case. It
rained, hailed and stormed terrible words&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">werkwoorden</span>,
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">voorzetsels</span>, and especially <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">tusschenwerpsels</span>.</p>

<p>Terence and I ran.</p>

<p>On reaching safety outside Terence asked me:
&ldquo;What was she angry about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;as likely as not it&rsquo;s something
out of the grammar. I believe I didn&rsquo;t use the
right idiom. You have to be very particular about
these things, you see.</p>

<p>I said <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vragen <em>voor</em> een boterham</span>, I think; and
it should be <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vragen <em>om</em></span>. Still she made far too big
a fuss over it: and I&rsquo;d tell her so, if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we got outside of her garden plot and
had latched the gate behind us, I turned to wave
our grammarian a graceful adieu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REPARTEE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Baker!</span>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Banket baker! Wees niet zoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

I sank my voice to a confidential whisper, to
make the irrelevancy sound as like wit as possible,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">maar,

<p>I still flatter myself that the exit was worthy
of the occasion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<small>THE DEVOTED NURSE.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel</span>,&rdquo; continued Jack; &ldquo;it was these experiences
that made me begin to doubt the value
of my Berlitz soliloquy-method. But Terence
helped me to give the system a really good
trial; and he worked as hard as I did.</p>

<p>It was quite different with Kathleen. When
she came back from Germany, she was keen on
art, but apparently had been moping about something.
And she refused to study any more Dutch.</p>

<p>That was before the accident, you see. After
that, she was quite angelic and nursed her
father assiduously, and the landlady&rsquo;s little son, too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ACCIDENT.</div>

<p>You know, of course, that uncle got a severe
shock from a motor-bike along the canal. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span>
who had been prowling around, to give his &ldquo;chat&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
an airing, ran across just in time to push the
absent-minded old gentleman out of the way. But
the lad was thrown on the ground and badly
hurt. Uncle pulled round soon enough&mdash;his indignation
at the motor cyclist helped him, as he had
some vague idea, if he were up and about, he
could get the culprit arrested. But <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> grew steadily
worse for the first week. The violent fall and the
bruise were both very bad for the plucky youngster.</p>

<p>Kathleen kept going back and forward, looking
after the sufferers. She said she never could repay
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> enough for saving her father&rsquo;s life. It appears
to have been a &lsquo;close shave&rsquo;, at the edge of that
deep canal; and Uncle nearly had them all in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SUITOR&rsquo;S MISTAKE.</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, he had spent the morning
with me, telling me about his grand &lsquo;find&rsquo; of
original Celtic manuscripts in Germany, and about
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen&rsquo;s</span> kindness. I never saw him so taken
with anybody! In Bonn he had got wind of these
precious Celtic relics; and, as everything was closed
at the University at that time of the year, he
worried and fumed, till he met some of the
authorities that knew <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>. Immediately
he had banged off a telegram to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span>, requesting
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen&rsquo;s</span> private influence; and, to his delight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that young man came joyfully in person. Of course
he would! It was too good a chance to be missed.
Indeed it was just the opportunity he wanted. And
yet he and Kathleen quarrelled fiercely over trifles
all the time.</p>

<p>But I was telling you about my uncle&rsquo;s escape.
It seems he was ambling along in his usual
oblivious style, on the sunny side of the street,
when he stopped (no doubt painfully near the edge
of the canal) to note down something that occurred
to him for his book. Just then a motor-cycle
turned the corner at a fiendish speed, and was
nearly over him. Uncle is the most helpless of
mortals at such times&mdash;and he was stepping hurriedly
into the canal, when <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> bounded across
the road and pulled him right.</p>

<p>The bike-tourist must have been a heartless
fellow; for he never swerved, but bore down at
full tilt on both rescuer and rescued, while they
were still on the edge of the water.</p>

<p>The youthful <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span>, however, is both original
and daring; for he turned the motor man aside
as cleverly as if he had Boyton in his hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO DUTCH NEEDED.</div>

<p>He either flung himself or his cap against the
advancing horror. Terence says it was the kitten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
he threw. In any case the little fellow did, as a
last resource, try to protect both his dear kitty
and the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Engelschen Mijnheer</span>, at some risk to himself.
The &ldquo;chat&rdquo; was unharmed, but fled up an adjacent
elm, whence it had to be coaxed down at dusk
with endless saucerfuls of milk.</p>

<p>This task Kathleen took on herself, after we
discovered that Dr. MacNamara, though shaken,
was not injured. Nothing would have pleased
you better than to have seen her beaming face
as she brought the trembling little kitty to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span>&rsquo;s
bedside. She didn&rsquo;t know a word of Dutch; but
managed to communicate quite easily, by signs,
with <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan&rsquo;s</span> mother, whom she promised to come
often and see.</p>

<p>We all assumed, at first, that the little fellow
had escaped scot-free; but, in a day or two, he
was in high fever, and unconscious. He had got
a contusion, the doctor said, and would be confined
to his cot for weeks.</p>

<p>It was marvellous to see how Kathleen comforted
the poor mother, without either grammar,
Polite Dialogue, or the use of <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">JAN&rsquo;S</span> INCOHERENCES.</div>

<p>I grew quite jealous and envious. Here was I
who had been slaving at syntax and accidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for weeks, and I couldn&rsquo;t carry on an intelligent
conversation for two minutes without deviating
into metaphysics, or getting into a quarrel; while
my cousin (who said she hated Dutch) could get
through the niceties of sick-room nursing, and the
subtleties of heartening up the poor hysterical
mother, with the utmost ease and success.</p>

<p>And I knew for certain that she couldn&rsquo;t go
through the Present Optative of &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik graauw, ik
kef en ik kweel</span>&rsquo;, or give one of the rules for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gij
(lieden)</span>&mdash;no, not to save her life. But she was
never at a loss, for all that. A more devoted
nurse, indeed, I cannot imagine.</p>

<p>At the crisis, when the little sufferer was really
in danger, she used to watch by him hours at
a stretch, to relieve the helpless mother.</p>

<p>The serious turn came all at once; and no aid
was at hand. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> was in pain, and wandered in
his talk, crying out that the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">motor-fiets</span> was hunting
him into the canal, for having rescued a <span class="g"  xml:lang="nl">vreemdeling</span>;
and pouring forth such a torrent of elementary
English and Boyton-Dutch as surprised us all.</p>

<p>I fancy it was, in part, my early translations
he had treasured up; for some of my mistakes
about handcuffs and dogcollars figured amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
incoherences; and it was pitiable to hear him plead
for a <span class="g"  xml:lang="nl">zie beneden</span> to wrap round his injured arm&mdash;already
bandaged as tightly as he could bear it.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">EEN STUK OF EEN.</div>

<p>Then he kept ringing the changes on an expression
I must have used in argument with his mother
the day I persuaded her to keep his bedraggled
foundling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het is geen menigte poesjes, zegt Mijnheer;
het is maar een stuk of een. Heus, moe, laat hem
blijven. Niet bang, hoor, schattie, je bent maar
een stuk of een! Pas op, Mijnheer, daar komt de
fiets!</span>&rdquo; And so on <span class="g" lang="it" xml:lang="it">da capo</span>.</p>

<p>So wild and restless was he, the second evening
of the fever, that we had to summon the doctor
unexpectedly, quite late.</p>

<p>Yes; his condition was disquieting, and we must
get him to sleep. It was largely a matter of nursing,
at the moment; new medicine was sent for; his
head was to be kept cool; and only one watcher
was to remain in the room. Above all, no noise.
If the English <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">juffrouw</span>, who seemed to understand
the lad&rsquo;s state, would consent to sit up to
two or three o&rsquo;clock, so much the better. The
excited mother could have a rest meantime. Otherwise
she would be fit for nothing next day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">KITTY GIVES <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">KOPJES</span>.</div>

<p>But no sooner had the good doctor softly closed
the front door, than my landlady declared it was
her intention to watch all night.</p>

<p>Kathleen was at her wits&rsquo; end. In vain did
she make signs and talk emphatic English in her
high voice, or try coaxing with a bit of the brogue.
All her feminine free-masonry failed to communicate
the faintest idea to the mother.</p>

<p>Uncle MacNamara, who had been waiting to
take his daughter back to the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen</span>, tried moral
suasion in his own particular brand of German,
and even in other tongues.&mdash;Terence says his
father recited a well-known passage from the Iliad
in his eagerness to be persuasive!&mdash;But all without
avail. She wouldn&rsquo;t heed anybody; and she wouldn&rsquo;t
go; she sat close to the cot, rocking violently to
and fro, and moaning &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijn eigen kind! mijn
eigen kind!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little fevered face was puckered with a
new perplexity at the sound of all this grief and
the familiar voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Moeder</span>,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">moederr! Daar komt ie
weer! Hij wou me in &rsquo;t water gooien. Moeder,
vasthoue, hoor!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was most painful; for my landlady&rsquo;s impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hysterics were making the lad worse every
moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A QUIET SLEEP.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Is poesje ook weggeloopen?</span>&rdquo; he said presently.
A happy thought struck Kathleen. She stole downstairs,
and presently returned with the &lsquo;chat&rsquo;, which
was purring vigorously and giving &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kopjes</span>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>As she placed the soft furry creature in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan&rsquo;s</span>
hands, he stopped moaning and stroked it joyfully.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dag, Kitty!</span>&rdquo; he said with delight. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ben je terug?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently he thought it was I who had restored
the wanderer, for he explained: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen praatje,
mijnheer:</span> Zat is mine naiz litle chat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, exhausted and satisfied, he dropped into
a sound sleep.</p>
<hr class="l2"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />

<small>GOSSIP AND DIPLOMACY.</small></h2>


<p>The strain was over; and the little lad slumbered
peacefully,&mdash;until dawn, as it proved. We got
the mother gradually quieted, and at last induced
to go off to bed, leaving Kathleen in charge for
the night. About half-past-one, Terence and I,
growing hungry, extemporised a sort of pic-nic in
the kitchen; but Kathleen wouldn&rsquo;t touch anything
we brought her.</p>

<p>It was then I began to notice how grave she
was, and silent.</p>

<p>But I must say, nobody could be more devoted
than she was to the youthful invalid.</p>

<p>He awoke rather early after his timely sleep,
but much calmer. And&mdash;a good sign&mdash;he
had a healthy &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">trek</span>&rsquo;, which we were gratified to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
see in operation upon &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">beschuit</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">melk</span>&rsquo;, before
his mother arrived to resume the reins of authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISCOURAGED SUITOR.</div>

<p>As we escorted Kathleen to her hotel in the
cool of the morning, we found her singularly
irresponsive, not to say depressed; and I somehow
got wind of the fact that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>, who
had motored up to the Hague, on hearing of her
father&rsquo;s accident, had been prowling about the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vieux</span> <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Doelen</span> ever since. He had visited Dr. MacNamara
almost every day; but Kathleen had kept
studiously aloof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he likes father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
glad he came so often to see him. Not very
interesting, otherwise! In any case he has suddenly
vanished into space!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The evening before, when she was on her way
to my landlady&rsquo;s to watch by the sick boy, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van
Leeuwen</span> had met her right in front of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mauritshuis</span>.
But she had treated him with such
stately indifference, and greeted his remarks with
such frigid courtesy, that the good-natured fellow
was really hurt. He had in fact returned the
same evening to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span>.</p>

<p>Kathleen said she was very glad, except for
her father&rsquo;s sake. But she didn&rsquo;t give one the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
impression of being enthusiastic about it, and I
drew my own conclusions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILL KATHLEEN STUDY DUTCH?</div>

<p>On reaching the Doelen, we found a hasty
scrawl from the very man we had been talking
of&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>&mdash;inviting Terence and myself
to a cycling tour in his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll go next Friday,&rdquo; Terence
broke out; &ldquo;at least, if you&rsquo;re ready then, Jack.
We&rsquo;ll have a grand time. Dad is all right now;
and that funny little kid is on the mend. So we
can go with a clear conscience. Say, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s like you boys&rdquo;, said Kathleen banteringly,
but without the ghost of a smile, &ldquo;to
go cycling about, enjoying yourselves, no matter
what happens to others! I&rsquo;m still anxious about
that child. And I do wish I understood him
better when he talks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for that&rdquo;, I interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
the key to it, in an instant. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan&rsquo;s</span> reminiscences
are all about my Dutch. Well, I&rsquo;ll lend you my
diary, and the most entertaining Grammar in
Holland. Besides, I&rsquo;ve written a monograph on
obvious blunders, English into Dutch. Read these,
now, when you&rsquo;re tending this convalescent boy-hero

bound; and it&rsquo;ll shake him up, and do you a
world of good yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INTERESTING COACH.</div>

<p>&ldquo;What a silly cousin, to be sure!&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;You forget, sir, I need some one to explain
all your double-Dutch. Get me a &lsquo;coach&rsquo; now, a
competent one, who knows everything, and I&rsquo;ll
give your booklet a trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; I said, as we parted.</p>

<p>And I held her to it. My diary kept her amused
for a couple of days, as she watched in the sick-room.
It roused her out of her depression, and she got
into the way of reading things to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> as he recovered.</p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t remain quite smileless; but grew
interested enough in Dutch to demand my monograph
and&mdash;above all&mdash;the Grammar!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have them both,&rdquo; I assured her,&mdash;&ldquo;the
booklet on the spot; and the Grammar,
when I get as far as <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span> and don&rsquo;t need to
use it for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I have it sooner? I&rsquo;m dying with
curiosity to see that awful book. Or, when you
are there, and any of your friends are coming
to the Hague, just send it with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;coach&rsquo; coming up in a day
or two. I&rsquo;ll send it along.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DIPLOMATIC EPISTLE.</div>

<p>I fancied her eyes gave a bit of a flicker. But
she was meek and friendly: so I knew it was all
right. She hadn&rsquo;t asked what kind of coach. But
she&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>

<p>That very instant I went home and wrote <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van
Leeuwen</span> that we&mdash;Terence and I&mdash;were
starting next day, by train, for <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span>, whence
we should have a run through <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gelderland</span>.</p>

<p>There was no note-paper in the house, but I
couldn&rsquo;t wait. So I a penned what I had to say
on a series of visiting cards,&mdash;numbering them: 1,
2, 3 up to 10, and enclosing them in a portly
yellow envelope. It was the only thing I had. I
was pleased to notice its impressive aspect, as
that would prevent its getting lost readily.</p>

<p>For I attached much importance to that communication.</p>

<p>In it I prepared <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen&rsquo;s</span> mind, indirectly
and circuitously, for apprehending the idea that
Miss MacNamara was now deeply interested in
Dutch; and was studying it to help her in nursing
that sick boy. Also that, as she had grown much
too sombre of late with the responsibilities she
had assumed, we were trying to brighten her
up. When the lad was quite well, we should all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
do the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Friesland</span> meres, before we returned to
Kilkenny. But not for a while yet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BRINK OF A ROMANCE.</div>

<p>And so on. I hinted as distantly as I could,
that he had motored back to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span> a trifle
too soon. We were <em>all</em> sorry he had left so suddenly.
Even yet, if he would leave his camera at
home&mdash;the one with the loud click&mdash;and if
he wouldn&rsquo;t be too exclusively immersed in Celtic
manuscripts, and avoided arguing about the Suffragettes,
when he did meet with the MacNamara
family, there was no reason to suppose that his
offences were beyond pardon. All this in shadowy
outline&mdash;for fear he would motor up like a
Fury, and either break his neck on the way, or
spoil everything by premature action.</p>

<p>I made the haze quite thick, here and there,
on the visiting cards&mdash;their form lent itself to
obscurity&mdash;and I told him I should see him
without fail within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have to ask a favour at his hands
about a grammar.</p>

<p>Terence was well: the Doctor was well, went
to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Leyden</span> daily to the Library. We expected to
reach <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Velperweg</span> toward midday. Don&rsquo;t be out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I posted the yellow missive with my own hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and reckoned out by the &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bus-lichting</span>&rsquo; plate, that
it would be collected that night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WELL EARNED REPOSE.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Tour or no tour, to-morrow,&rdquo; I said to myself,
heaving a sigh of relief, after my race to the
pillar-box; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the brink of a romance, if
the protagonists only knew it. A little bad Dutch
now seems all that is required. And we can rely
on Boyton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Queer, when you think of it, that you sometimes
hold people&rsquo;s destinies in the hollow of your hand!</p>

<p>However, I didn&rsquo;t philosophise much, but got
to sleep as soon as ever I could,&mdash;content as
from a good day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />

<small>A STUDY IN CHARACTER.</small></h2>


<p>Next morning we were up at dawn to be in
time for the first express. We cycled to the station;
but a row of market-boats, that had reached the
one and only canal-bridge on our route, kept us
waiting till they filed past; and we missed our train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choost kon!&rdquo; exclaimed a porter cheerfully,
as he took our cycles. &ldquo;Day-train choost away&mdash;von&mdash;two&mdash;meenit&mdash;ako!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind&rdquo;, I rejoined. &ldquo;There are plenty
of day-trains left. It&rsquo;s early yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he looked doubtful, I added in the vernacular:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wij zijn in goeje tijd voor den bommel;
nie-waar? Zes vier en veertig.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Net, mijnheer</span>&rdquo;, he replied, grinning appreciation
of my Dutch, as he led the way to the <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">loket</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNWELCOME INTERRUPTION.</div>

<p>There were no difficulties there. You merely
had to say. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Twee enkele reis, Arnhem. Tweede
klasse. Gewone biljetten</span>,&rdquo; and there you were.
And these &lsquo;<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gewone biljetten</span>&rsquo; made the forwarding
of the cycles simplicity itself.</p>

<p>Duly provided with the forthcoming <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">fiets-papiertjes</span>
we ensconced ourselves in a non-smoker,
and&mdash;to while away the time&mdash;rehearsed
our Traveller&rsquo;s Dialogue. That is the system
I had made out long since, but now partly forgotten.
Terence had benefited by my tuition, and
could now keep the ball rolling, with more or
less relevant remarks, whilst I enumerated the
parts of a train, and talked about tickets and towns.</p>

<p>So smoothly did our conversation run that we
were tempted to repeat it with variations; and
we were just in the middle of as fine an elocutionary
practice as ever you heard, when there
was a scramble on the platform; and in there
bounded into our compartment&mdash;just as the
train began to move off&mdash;three tourists, hot
and breathless!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LINGUIST AND THE SATELLITE.</div>

<p>They were Englishmen,&mdash;London shopkeepers
in a small way, I guessed, from their talk. Two
of them, father and son, seemed a bit hectoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and dictatorial; the third was an admiring satellite.
For very shame&rsquo;s sake Terence and I didn&rsquo;t
like to drop our Dialogue as if we were culprits;
so we lowered our voices, and went through it
to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Our new companions listened for a moment,
and the truculent father said, &ldquo;Neouw, there
y&rsquo;are, Tom! wot&rsquo;s hall that tork abeout? You
kneouw the lingo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Tom&mdash;he was about nineteen&mdash;posed,
apparently, as a linguist. He knew the language
all right, he said. &ldquo;It was kind of debased German.
He had picked it up from a boy at school.
It was the sime to &rsquo;im as Hinglish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wottaw thiy siyin, Tom?&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; muttered Tom, &ldquo;abeout the kaind &rsquo;v
dai it is, an&rsquo;, hall thet rot. But no use listenin&rsquo;
to them. They tork such a bad patois, an&rsquo; hungrimmentikil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The satellite looked impressed. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye tork
&rsquo;t &rsquo;s wull &rsquo;s French an&rsquo; Juh&rsquo;man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hall the sime to me&rdquo;, said Tom. &ldquo;The sime
&rsquo;z Hinglish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The satellite&rsquo;s awe deepened. Presently, however,
he spied the cattle in the fields as we sped along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
He pointed them out to Tom. &ldquo;Fine ceouws, miy
wu&rsquo;d!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BACKSLIDER</div>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! better in Bu&rsquo;kshire!&rdquo; replied the
linguist.</p>

<p>In a minute or two he broke out again: &ldquo;Lot
&rsquo;v ceouws in a field here, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;faw mo&rsquo; &rsquo;n Essex!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man of humility had an eye for landscape,
and couldn&rsquo;t be repressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, crikkie&rdquo;, he exclaimed, &ldquo;look at that
meadow an&rsquo; canal. Ain&rsquo;t it stunnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the father came to his son&rsquo;s rescue in defence
of Old England. &ldquo;Yeou jist go deouwn Nawf&rsquo;k
wiy! Faw better th&rsquo;n this wretched &rsquo;ole!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The satellite evidently felt reproved for his
lack of patriotism, for he subsided immediately.
But he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. You might see by
the way he looked out of the window that he
was in ecstasies over the glowing panorama before
him, in spite of Norfolk and Essex and the
contempt of his fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>Meantime Terence, fuming and in disgust, had
buried himself in the columns of Tit-Bits. The
truculent one recognised the familiar weekly, and
drawing his son&rsquo;s attention to both reader and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
paper he announced quite audibly; &ldquo;&rsquo;E can read
Hinglish. &rsquo;E looks hintelligent.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?</div>

<p>Advancing half way across the carriage, he
cleared his throat, and addressed Terence at the
top of his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;a hem!&mdash;a hem!&mdash;do you&mdash;<em>speak
Hinglish?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>One could have heard the last two words in
the next compartment.</p>

<p>Terence looked up; and I saw by the twinkle
in his eye what he was going to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein?</span>&rdquo; he interrogated with a nasal whoop
like a subdued trumpet. He had learnt this at
school from his French teacher and was a profiscient
at rendering it accurately. It gave an unconventional
flavour to his manner&mdash;which was
just what he wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein?</span>&rdquo; he trumpeted again, with an air of
amiable curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hawskt&mdash;do you&mdash;hem!&mdash;<em>speak</em>&mdash;<em>Hinglish?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ze Engels Langwitch? Yes: I shpeak him&mdash;von
leetle bit. You alzóo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi &rsquo;m &rsquo;n Englishman,&rdquo; said the truculent one
proudly, a trifle taken aback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HE MEANS THE EAST END.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zoo?</span>&rdquo; replied Terence. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ach zoo. Ja. Jawohl.
Zoo gaat &rsquo;t.</span> Beauti-ful&mdash;lang-witch! Beauti&mdash;ful!&rdquo;
he enunciated with painful distinctness and
many twitches of his face.</p>

<p>All this fell in with the tourists&rsquo; preconceived
ideas of foreign utterance. They exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You kin mike yors&rsquo;ff hunderstood, hall raight,&rdquo;
interposed the linguist. &ldquo;Were you ever in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered my cousin slowly, counting
off upon his fingers. &ldquo;Alzoo&mdash;von&mdash;two&mdash;tree&mdash;time&mdash;Mooch
peoples&mdash;in Londe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like London?&rdquo; queried Truculence
Senior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Londe?&mdash;No! No&mdash;boddy like Londe.&mdash;Fery
ugly! Mooch smoke&mdash;alzoo fogk.&mdash;Men
see nozzing. Mooch poor peoples&mdash;No boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like London!! Why London&rsquo;s the gritest
city in the wu&rsquo;ld.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pity me mooch&mdash;for London peoples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;m aleoun, gov&rsquo;ner,&rdquo; said the linguist,
furious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Heast End &rsquo;e&rsquo;s got in &rsquo;is &rsquo;ed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Heouses &rsquo;v Pawl&rsquo;mint&mdash;and the
Tride?&rdquo; reasoned the father, reluctant to abandon
the controversy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Houses Parliament?&mdash;nozzing!&rdquo; said Terence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
recklessly. &ldquo;Trade?&mdash;alzoo nozzing! American
man hef all ze trade. Fery clever. Alzoo German
man. Fery clever.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAKE UP, JOHN BULL.</div>

<p>That was a clincher. Terence had amply avenged
their contempt of the scenery they were passing
through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the bloomin&rsquo; ass aleoun&rdquo;, cried Truculence
junior. &ldquo;&rsquo;E deoun&rsquo;t kneouw wot &rsquo;e&rsquo;s torkin&rsquo; abeout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the shot had gone home. The papers had
been full of &ldquo;Wake up, John Bull!&rdquo; of late, and
he felt uncomfortable. Yet though we relapsed
into silence, it wasn&rsquo;t for long. For soon the senior
member of the trio got very exasperated with a
local railway-guide that he had been consulting.
&ldquo;Bit of a muddle that!&rdquo; he cried contemptuously,
flinging the booklet on the seat. &ldquo;Cawn&rsquo;t mike
&rsquo;ed or tile of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to my cousin: &ldquo;Can you tell me
&rsquo;ow far it is to Gooday&mdash;or Goodee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terence replied briskly in appalling English:
&ldquo;Goodee&mdash;I know-not. Zat iss nozzing. Good-day,
zat is <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goejen-dag</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said the tourist; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere you aw!&rdquo;
pointing to the name of the place on his Cook&rsquo;s
ticket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">GOUDA</span> HISTORICAL.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Terence, getting so foreign as to
be scarcely intelligible. &ldquo;Zat-iss&mdash;Gouda. Beaut-ti-ful
city!&rdquo; And he rolled his eyes in apparent
awe at the magnificence of that unpretentious
market-town. &ldquo;Ex-qui-seet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ow far is it?&rdquo; queried his interlocutor. &ldquo;Ow
long, in the trine&mdash;to Gouda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Alzoo</span>,&rdquo; returned my cousin, purposely misunderstanding
him. &ldquo;Yes; ferry long. Long times.
Ferry old ceety. Much years. Tree&mdash;four&mdash;century!
Historique!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the impatient traveller. &ldquo;But&mdash;wen&mdash;d&rsquo;we&mdash;arrive?
get there&mdash;you
kneouw&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You vil arrivé,&rdquo; pronounced Terence in the
same baby-English, &ldquo;haff&mdash;of&mdash;ze&mdash;klok.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawf &rsquo;n eour; that wot &rsquo;e&rsquo;s drivin&rsquo; et,&rdquo; grumbled
the Linguist.</p>

<p>They kept on asking questions and criticising
us to our faces, when they talked together. Our
dress, our appearance, our complexions were all
adjudged to be woefully foreign; and they got
so patronising that I had to put in an odd word,
in real English, to Terence, now and again, just
to prevent them going too far. Imperceptibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
conversation became general; and as I forced
Terence out of his assumed ignorance of English,
the surprise of the tourists deepened into dismay, for
they noticed we were talking more and more
quickly, and idiomatically as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREIGNERS DON&rsquo;T GET THE HANG OF IT.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hi siy!&rdquo; whispered the satellite, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re learnin&rsquo;
Hinglish from hus! I&rsquo;m blest hif thiy weount
soon be nearly &rsquo;s good &rsquo;s we are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you fear,&rdquo; said young Conceit. &ldquo;Furriners
never git the &rsquo;ang of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; corroborated Truculence.</p>

<p>But the open criticising of our appearance was
at an end.</p>

<p>Our companions looked anything but conciliatory
when a crowd of rustics poured into the carriage
at one of the stations. It was some sort of market
at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gouda</span>; and the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bommel</span> was crammed now.
Finally the guard scurried along, and half hoisted,
half pushed a peasant woman with her three
children into the compartment.</p>

<p>It was odd to see Truculence rise and help the
little ones in; and odder still to see the children
smile up into that formidable face, when they
took their seats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CONFIDENT YOUNGSTER.</div>

<p>I noticed the twinkle in his eye, however, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he watched the bairnies trying to scramble to the
window. He was evidently much interested in a
bright little boy of seven with dreamy eyes, who
was bent on amusing himself; and I could see
that he wanted badly to shake hands with him
and his tot of a sister, and ask them their names.
He evidently regretted his inability to speak Dutch;
but he made up for his silence by reaching the
boy the window-strap, with a nod of comradeship.
The little fellow took it eagerly and, after playing
with it a moment or two, slid off his seat and
actually climbed up beside Truculence (the scorner
of everything non-British) and pushing Truculence
to one side, looked out of Truculence&rsquo;s
window.</p>

<p>So surprisingly passive was my severe compatriot
at all this that I hazarded a guess, and said: &ldquo;You
have a boy of five at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short clearing the pane for his tiny
companion, and sat stock-still. It might have been
a statue that was beside me so little did he move.
Not a sound in answer to my question!</p>

<p>Quickly I glanced at him.</p>

<p>Oh, I could have bitten off my tongue when I
saw that man&rsquo;s face! It was drawn and white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and not at all like the scornful censor&rsquo;s of a few
minutes before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ENGLISH UNCLE FOR <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">CLAAS</span>.</div>

<p>He continued staring out of the window a moment;
then he turned and said quietly: &ldquo;I &rsquo;ad&mdash;a
little fair haired fellow&mdash;a year ago..... &rsquo;E
was six.... An&rsquo; the born image of thet kiddie
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he stroked the kiddie&rsquo;s head, which was
now glued to the glass in an eager endeavour to
see a passing train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E used to be that fond of machinery, too,&rdquo; he
continued, opening a city bag and bringing out
a diminutive flying-machine, a &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">twee-dekker</span>&rdquo; that
he had evidently bought in the Hague. &ldquo;I got
it, &rsquo;cos it minded me of the things my boy used
to pliy with. But I&rsquo;ve nobody to give it to.</p>

<p>May I as well give it to this kid. Tell &rsquo;is
mother &rsquo;e&rsquo;s to keep it. Tell &rsquo;er that I&rsquo;m &rsquo;s <strong>hold
uncle from Hingland</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did my best. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Claas</span> grasped the situation at
once, as far as the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">twee-dekker</span> was concerned.
The mother was slower. Consternation and politeness
took away her speech for an instant, but
she soon recovered and put <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Claas</span> through his drill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh mijnheer, hij is zoo bij de hand!</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DRAM-DRINKING AT EIGHT?</div>

<p>Then she overwhelmed us all with family reminiscences,
which none of us understood a word of,
but which could not be stopped. It was a relief
to get to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gouda</span>; and the tension of our feelings
was pleasantly relaxed by observing the profound
disgust that mantled the Londoner&rsquo;s brow, when
after helping the children on to the platform, he
was accosted by a vendor of local dainties, who
loudly insisted on selling <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goudsche Sprits</span> to the
company. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a Johnny wants the kiddies
an&rsquo;all of us to liquor up&mdash;on neat spirits&mdash;before
hight o&rsquo;clock in the mo&rsquo;nin&rsquo;! Shime, I call it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WUIF ES, OOM!</div>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Claas</span> had to say &rsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to his new uncle,
and we watched proceedings from our window.
The Linguist ignored the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu</span> completely; but
the Satellite manfully backed up the father, and
shook hands all round. A knot of porters gathered
to seize the luggage of the big Englishman, who
stood, masterful and bored, in the midst of the
hubbub. His jaw and chin were those of Rhadamanthus;
but his eyes were soft as they rested
on the boyish figure descending the stairs with
his baby-sister. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Claas</span> was waving a small hand to
his new uncle who had given him the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Twee-dekker</span>;
but his new uncle was not waving anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to him. So Claas stopped short, and cried
at the top of his voice: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wuif es oom! wui&mdash;uif
es, nouw! Je moet wuife!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s &rsquo;e up to, the young rescal?&rdquo; he asked me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he wants you to make a sign of
goodbye. It&rsquo;s always done here,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>Well, he produced, from some place or other, a
brilliant jubilee handkerchief&mdash;he was a dressy
man and had plenty of coloured things&mdash;and
shook it with both hands to his tiny friend. And
the last I saw of him, as the train steamed on
towards Utrecht, was, his waving of this silk
banner to the little boy on the steps; the stern
lips were relaxed into a smile; the defiant face
was quite wistful as he repeated: &ldquo;The young
rescal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goudsche sprits</span> seller, in his tour
up and down the platform, approached the burly
Londoner again, and seeing him now in an unexpectedly
melting mood, at once proffered his
delicacies with noisy persistence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Goudsche sprits! Goudsche sprits!</span> Sir,&rdquo; he bawled
in the Englishman&rsquo;s face, holding out a packet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS BARK IS WORSE THAN HIS BITE.</div>

<p>Truculence was quite glad of the interruption.
He blew his nose violently on his marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
handkerchief, and turned upon the local merchant
with a glare of indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along! How dare you? D&rsquo;ye take me for
a drunkard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Formidable customer that!&rdquo; whispered Terence
at my elbow. &ldquo;Still I think his bark is worse than
his bite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And there
are more of his kind.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />

<small lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">BELET!</small></h2>


<p>We got on famously at <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Utrecht</span> and at the
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span> station. In less time than it takes to tell
it we were mounted on our cycles with our bags
in front of us, and ready for the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Terence. And indeed
it was. Charmed by the ease with which we had
got along so safely, I felt a trifle elated over our
linguistic victories, and had already begun to dream
of fresh fields to conquer, when we drew near
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen&rsquo;s</span> villa on the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Velperweg</span>&mdash;a
lovely spot.</p>

<p>We dismounted to make sure we were right,
and then walked briskly up the avenue.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a timid-looking servant,
who said: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Er is belet.</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WELKE MIJNHEER?</div>

<p>It was the first time I had met the expression;
yet it sounded oddly familiar. Ah, of course. For
the last ten days I had been studying <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">biljetten</i>
out of the railway-guide. There was apparently a
slight provincialism in her way of the rendering
the liquid in the middle of the word, but this didn&rsquo;t
matter. <strong>There was a ticket</strong>, then. Puzzling, very.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja?</span>&rdquo; I said tentatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Er is belet</span>,&rdquo; she repeated. The intonation was
decisive; but as her manner was expectant, I took
it for a question, had we tickets? Queer, certainly.
Yes; I assured her we had,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">gewone biljetten,
retour,&mdash;geldig voor éen dag.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shifted her ground and said, &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer
heeft belet.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now you know how hard it is to be sure what
person servants are talking about when they say
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer</span>. Did she mean me or her master? &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Welke
Mijnheer?</span>&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ben ik mijnheer, of is Mijnheer
mijnheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raising her voice she announced deliberately,
but with increasing irritation: &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer van Leeuwen&mdash;heeft&mdash;belet.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha&rdquo;, I whispered to Terence, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my big letter
she&rsquo;s talking about. Well, I&rsquo;m glad it came in time&rdquo;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">AANSLAGBILJET</span>.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Uitstekend!</span>&rdquo; I hastened to say. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dat biljet is
van mij. Dus mijnheer verwacht mij, niet waar?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nervously closed the door a bit. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik heb
al gezaid&mdash;vanmorgen heeft mijnheer <em>expres
belet gegeven</em>.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik het hebben, dan</span>&rdquo;, I enquired politely;
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijn brief&mdash;dat geschreven biljet?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hé?</span>&rdquo; she said, visibly relieved, opening the
door widely as she spoke. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neem mij niet kwalijk,
Mijnheer. Ik wist niet dat u van de belasting was.
Komt u om het beschrijvingsbiljet?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She retreated a step, timidly, into the hall, and
glanced at an elderly butler, who in silence had
been standing at a discreet distance listening to
our colloquy. The butler moved forward, and in
an apologetic tone murmured, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer, het beschrijvingsbiljet
is nog niet klaar. Of komt u met
een aanslagbiljet?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I had a newspaper in my hand full of talk
about a &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">moordaanslag</span>&rsquo; I repudiated the latter idea
indignantly. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Geen denken aan!</span>&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>The butler came out and stood on the steps,
enquiring &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Is U soms een schatter.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Schatter?</span> (<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Schat</span>, a treasure; <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schatter</span>, a <em>treasurer</em>.
I reasoned.) &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wel nee: geen schatter ben ik,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
alleen Eerlijk Secretaris van de Studenten-Club</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MYSTERIOUS OBSTACLE.</div>

<p>In the hall a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">loopmeisje</span> and a seamstress stood
transfixed with curiosity. How could I get this
mad interview terminated?</p>

<p>The deferential butler began to grow suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Komt U niet van de belasting?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik weet het niet</span>,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>That was enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer geeft belet altijd &lsquo;s morgens</span>,&rdquo; he
said, adding, evidently with reference to my <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">eerlijk
secretaris.</span> &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wij zijn allemaal eerlijk hier!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We appeared to be dismissed!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terence,&rdquo; I said quickly; &ldquo;Look if b-e-l-e-t
is in the dictionary. They always hark back
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute he gave a mild shout: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here;
it means <em>hindrance</em>. Ah, I see. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Van Leeuwen</span> is
hindered seeing us. Hadn&rsquo;t we better go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De belet is niet erg, hoop ik?</span>&rdquo; I said to the
servant; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">ik hoop dat Mijnheer spoedig beter zal
worden, als het een ziekte is.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now at last we had mastered the mysteries of
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">belet</span>? No such thing!</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">WIJ KRIJGEN BELET.</div>

<p>Turning to go, I thought I might as well enquire
when van Leeuwen could be seen. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wanneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
kan ik soms Mijnheer zien?</span>&rdquo; Her reply confounded
me: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vandaag of morgen, maar U moet
<strong>belet vragen</strong>.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vragen!</span> surely not ask for an obstacle. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U
bedoelt <strong>weigeren</strong>, niet waar?</span>&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee: belet vragen, anders zal mijnheer u niet
ontvangen.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Terence!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;This is too awful!
<strong>He</strong> has this obstacle; he has given it to us; now
<strong>we</strong> must <strong>ask it again</strong>. And I don&rsquo;t even
know what it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, Jack. Don&rsquo;t ask anything else,
or you&rsquo;ll get us into a worse mess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; I said, appealing to the stolid
butler. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Moet ik verzoeken om weggestuurd te
worden? Of wat?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja Mijnheer, ik verzoek jullie maar weg te
gaan. Alstublieft!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solemn man looked like an archbishop.
He cleared his throat and added courteously:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maar, als U Mijnheer van Leeuwen wil spreken,
moet U belet <strong>laten vragen</strong>. Anders <strong>krijgt</strong>
U belet als U komt.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Schei uit!</span>&rdquo; I cried in dismay. &ldquo;Terence, let
us fly! for my brain won&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">IS MIJNHEER GEENGAGEERD?</div>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he interposed hastily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
silly or hysterical, now. Look here. I&rsquo;ve been
working the thing out in my head and think I
can see some sense in it. Perhaps it&rsquo;s all very
simple. Van Leeuwen may be only occupied for
the moment, and so can see us if we wait. Just
ask if they mean that he&rsquo;s merely engaged. He
mayn&rsquo;t be sick at all. There&rsquo;s the word for
<em>engaged</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he reached me the dictionary with this
thumb opposite: <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">geengageerd</i>, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">verpanden</i>, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">verloofd</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, I thought. There was wisdom in his calm
suggestion, though really I was sick making these
curious enquiries. But it seemed plain sailing now.
So with an ingratiating smile I just asked in a
matter of fact sort of way: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer is soms
geengageerd? Is het wel?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verloofd?</span>&rdquo; I added taking the next word,
as there was no manner of response forthcoming
to the first question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Verpanden?</span>&rdquo; whispered Terence with his eye
on the dictionary.</p>

<p>The company&mdash;there were some six of them
now clustering round the butler for protection&mdash;retreated
hastily into the recesses of the big hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and left that majestic man to shut the door. This
he did without delay, saying, somewhat nervously,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maak dat jullie weg gaat!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">EEN SPOEDIGE RESTAURATIE.</div>

<p>There was nothing left for us to do but to beat
a dignified retreat.</p>

<p>I made it as dignified as possible by, expressing
our best wishes for van Leeuwen&rsquo;s speedy
recovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Komplimenten aan Mijnheer, hoor; een spoedige
restauratie!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cycled off.</p>
<hr class="l2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />

<small>THE DAY-TRAIN.</small></h2>


<p>We had a delightful spin along the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Velperweg</span>.</p>

<p>Dismounting three or four times to admire
choice &lsquo;bits&rsquo; of scenery, we were enticed on and
on, and followed a side way that rose over a
gentle slope. From the ridge of this acclivity we
could watch the cloud shadows, violet and purple,
sweeping over wide moors, and by their subtle
contrasts bringing out the soft shimmering of the
distant sunlight. On the horizon we made out the
river and some hill-tops marked on our maps.
Terence was confident he saw <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nijmegen</span>; but
pushing on to get a still finer view, we came to
grief in crossing a heather &ldquo;brae&rdquo;. At least I did.
The front wheel was wrenched to one side; and
we had to foot it all the way to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Velp</span>. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
having left both machines at a cycle-mender&rsquo;s,
we started for a long tramp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOST IN THE WOOD.</div>

<p>That was a grand mistake, for we went too
far. There were other ranges of wooded hills to
be climbed, and the air was exhilarating. The
time passed quickly, so it was late in the afternoon
before we knew. Feeling more or less famished,
we ventured on a short cut through the
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Onzalige Bosch</span>&rdquo;; but soon were hopelessly lost.
It <strong>was</strong> a task to get on the main road.</p>

<p>Indeed we took several wrong turnings apparently,
for they seemed&mdash;it was hard to get
our proper orientation&mdash;to bring us back to the
same neighbourhood always. But at last we came
to a line of wooded hills, and discovered a cart
track that led us to a real high-way. This high-way
was a magnificent affair with high over-arching
trees; and on it, to our great relief, there
were tram-rails!</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">STOPT DE TRAM OP EEN WENK?</div>

<p>Help was near at hand. We put our best foot
foremost, so to speak, and hurried forward looking
in the dusk for a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halte</i>. Perhaps we may have
passed some <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halten</i>, but we didn&rsquo;t notice any;
and as we were fagged out, I was glad to come
upon a group of workmen who, I imagined, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
tell me about the tram. The question I wanted
to get solved was simple. Did the tram stop
merely at the official <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">halten</i>, or would the driver
pull up anywhere he got a passenger? If the bye-laws
of this particular tramway allowed the tram
to stop and pick up pedestrians anywhere all along
the line, we were quite safe; we should just sit
down on the roadside and rest. We shouldn&rsquo;t
walk another step.</p>

<p>The men were shovelling away at fallen leaves,
so I accosted them in my friendliest Dutch and
said: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Stop de tram overal?</span>&rdquo; As this was greeted
with the customary &ldquo;<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">blief?&rdquo;</i> I tried to be more
explicit. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Stop de tram op een wenk of een uitroepteeken?
Of stopt hij alleen op de halten?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This puzzled them all exceedingly; and one
elderly man mopped his brow with his handkerchief
and said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik mot es eve prakiseere.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">PRAKISEERE.</div>

<p>With that he stabbed his spade into the sod
at his foot and leaned on the top of it with both
arms, his eye fixed the while on me. I didn&rsquo;t
care for the performance, as his stare was discomfitingly
steady; but I allowed him for a while
to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">prakiseere</span> undisturbed.</p>

<p>Indeed I couldn&rsquo;t even guess what he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
trying to do. It looked like an exercise in
philosophic meditation or an attempt to hypnotise
me on the spot, and as he seemed in no
hurry to give me the information I desired, there
was nothing for it but ask one of the other road
menders.</p>

<p>Selecting the most intelligent looking of them.
I said &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kijk es, baas; houdt de tram op, op
een wuiving van een zakdoek? Of als men teekent
met een paraplu?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This second functionary shook his head sadly,
and leaned on <em>his</em> spade in turn, gazing at me
as if I had horns. There was a third man&mdash;close
at hand&mdash;quite a young fellow, halfway across
the road where he was standing as if petrified
by my previous conversation. However he wasn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;prakiseering,&rdquo; so I stepped across to him with
the slowly enunciated query: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Vertel me nou es:
wat voor signaal moet ik maken, als ik wensch
op genomen te worden?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was the promptest of the group, for he
replied glibly: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik weet het niet. Je mot eve by
de Politie gaan vragen.</span>&rdquo; But not a word about
the tram.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MY DUTCH BREAKS DOWN.</div>

<p>I gave it up. No information could possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be extracted from these roadmen. My Dutch
had quite broken down, and in disgust, I surrendered
the leading of the expedition wholly
to Terence.</p>

<p>Terence has a theory that he can make his
meaning clear by means of careful and scientific
gesticulation. Now he took his innings, while I
watched the proceedings from a comfortable seat
by the roadside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite clever at it,&rdquo; he shouted to me.
&ldquo;The tram will be here in two somethings&mdash;I
believe two hours&mdash;so we may as well move
on: it&rsquo;ll be no use to us, to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;your way of it!&rdquo; And
off we started, tired as we were. We weren&rsquo;t ten
minutes on the road till the tram was heard puffing
behind us; and catching sight of a kind of
double line in front of us we bounded towards
this spot in hopes there might be a halte there.
There <em>was:</em> and the tram waited half an hour
at it, and then went back again the way it had
come. We had to walk. Well, at all events we
reached <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Velp</span> at dark. My cycle was nicely mended,
so after getting some refreshments in an excellent
<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">logement</i> and taking a prolonged and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
earned rest, we mounted our bikes and rode straight
to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRAIN THAT NEVER STOPS.</div>

<p>So disgusted was I with my ill-success in Dutch
that I tackled the porters in English. An obliging
<span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">wit-jas</span> asked me if I would have the day-train.
&ldquo;Rather not,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;There will surely be
another train to-night. It&rsquo;s only nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first was a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bommel</span>, he said, and would do
for the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">fietsen</span>; but he recommended us to wait
for the day-train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! And stay here all night?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Day-trein will be here
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>How is that?</strong>&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;<strong>How</strong> in the wide
world can a <strong>Day-train go at night</strong>? or is it
because it started from Germany by day-light?
You surely don&rsquo;t reckon here by <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amerikaansche
tijd</span> for the sake of the tourists?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You not understand,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We call
it day-trein becos&rsquo; you pay more&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I interrupted; &ldquo;that would be a Pay-train,
then! Not Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said excitedly. &ldquo;Zis trein go
kwik!&mdash;not stop&mdash;<strong>anywheres</strong>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it doesn&rsquo;t stop, how can we get in?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I asked. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of moet ik <strong>belet vragen</strong> voor deze
Dag-trein? Geeft de trein belet?</span> You&rsquo;ll need a
special kind of ticket, too&mdash;perhaps an aanslagsbiljet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; only little <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bewijsje</span>&mdash;kwik trein&mdash;bring
Restoration&mdash;becos&rsquo;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? The Restoration! It turns day into
night, and brings back Charles&nbsp;II! Go on, please,
I can believe anything now!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MET HANGENDE POOTJES</span>&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">RE INFECTA</span>.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo! is this where you are?&rdquo; sounded gratefully
on our ears. It was <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>, who had
been expecting us all day, after he had heard about
our call, from the indignant butler. He had given
up all hope of seeing us, but we passed him by
in the dark, talking and laughing. He had followed
hot-speed to the station&mdash;in time to explain
the mysteries of the D-trein. My spirits rose. The
world was still ruled by reason. Of course we went
back with our rescuer. That was the original
plan, and I had a grammar to send with him to
the Hague.</p>

<p>As he waited, talking to Terence, I recalled
the cycles. The wit-jas demurred: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De fietsen zijn
al weg.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Neen, niet waar</span>,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Onmogelijk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hoor! Geen trein is weg. Daar zijn de papiertjes
ervan. Pak ze: breng de fietsen mee. Ik weiger

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />

<small>SUPPER AT A <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">BOERDERIJ</span>.</small></h2>


<p>That night, after Terence had retired, I had a
confidential talk with <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span>; and I begged
of him, as a great favour, to take the Grammar
to Kathleen, and&mdash;if he had time&mdash;give her
a little coaching in Dutch. He said he would&mdash;to
oblige me; and I was pleased to notice that
he started, taking Boyton with him, by the earliest
possible train. This was the six twenty&mdash;a
notorious <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">bommel</span> which brought him into the
Hague only seventeen minutes earlier than if he
had waited for a decent breakfast.</p>

<p>Enderby got to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Arnhem</span> about noon, and took
us &lsquo;in tow&rsquo; for our cycling tour. We had a glorious
week of it in Gelderland under his direction; but
there were no adventures worth speaking of. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ten days we were back at the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Residentie</span>, as &lsquo;brown
as berries and as gay as larks&rsquo;. It is Terence&rsquo;s
phrase, and I give it for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

<p>But at all events <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van Leeuwen</span> was gay enough now.
His pedagogic labours seemed to suit him, and Kathleen
was quite herself again. To hear her laugh now
was to imagine that you were back in Kilkenny in the
days before the suffragette question was mooted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE SHADE OF THE <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">PRIEELTJE</span>.</div>

<p>We were all delighted. Except perhaps Enderby.
That youth didn&rsquo;t appear more than half pleased at
the turn things had taken; but he had the grace to
keep out of the way and consoled himself with motoring.
One day&mdash;I had only sat down to luncheon&mdash;he
carried me off for a great run to the islands south of
Rotterdam. But the machine broke down twice before
we reached <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dordrecht</span>, and we had to content ourselves
with housing its fragments in a shed, and walking
to a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">boerderij</i> where my friend was well known.
Here, indeed, we were expected to supper; but we
arrived hours before we were due, and <em>minus</em> an automobile.
This necessitated explanations, which Enderby
seemed gracefully enough to make to the family
party in the garden. In a shady <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">prieeltje</span> there,
they regaled us with &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">liemonade</span>&rdquo;; and I occasioned
some consternation by rising twice to offer my seat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the mother and daughter respectively, who came in
after I had sat down. They wouldn&rsquo;t take the chair I
vacated for them, and appeared to resent my civility.
Enderby, too, made me uncomfortable by touching
my foot and saying, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;Take care what you&rsquo;re
about, O&rsquo;Neill&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Baas Willemse</span> was very sympathetic about the
mishap to our motor, and strongly recommended the
services of a gifted blacksmith of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Indeed, before we knew, he had a pony harnessed
in a sort of hooded tax-cart, in which he insisted in
driving Enderby to this wonderful mechanic, to have
the damaged car put to rights. And off they started.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNPREPARED GUEST.</div>

<p>It was only then that I realized the situation. Here
was I&mdash;without dictionary or phrase-book&mdash;left to
play the part of intelligent guest, unaided and unprepared.
And that was the first time in my life I was
&lsquo;spending the evening&rsquo; in a non-English-speaking
home. How would I get through it? I did hope that
the local Vulcan would be quick.</p>

<p>At first it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. What with remarks
about &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het prachtige weer</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het ongeluk</span>&rdquo;, and
what with playing with the children, I got along
quite smoothly for a while.</p>

<p>I even discoursed a little about the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the afternoon-sunlight and &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">het schilderachtige
van het zomerlandschap</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COWS&rsquo; OVERCOATS.</div>

<p>All this was taken in such good part that I
went further afield; and noticing a large number
of cattle with odd coverings on their backs, I
ventured on a comparison which I fancied might
interest the company. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">In Groot-Brittanje hebben de
koeien niet zoo dikwijls overjassen. Mag ik beleefd
vragen: gebeurt dat hier van wege de gezelligheid,
of van wege de gezondheid, of voor het mooi?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were all pleased at this, and gave me a lot
of talk about cows&mdash;which didn&rsquo;t make me much
the wiser.</p>

<p>By violent efforts I recalled some of my old choice
phrases, and passed myself somehow. But alas!
supper came; and then my real troubles began.</p>

<p>We all adjourned to a <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">binnen-kamer</span>, where an
ample spread awaited us. I was given the seat of
honour. It was a great pity, all agreed, that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer</span>
Enderby wasn&rsquo;t back: but they thought I might
be hungry. Well, I was&mdash;and with reason.
Nothing to eat since breakfast!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Thee of chocolaat, Mijnheer?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Thee, alstublieft</span>&rdquo;, I said.&mdash;And I got it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Krentebroodjes?</span>&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THANK YOU.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dank U</span>,&rdquo; I answered pleasantly, and reached
for one in a leisurely manner. You don&rsquo;t like to
parade your hunger, you know. Well, I hadn&rsquo;t been
prompt enough. A plateful from which I was about
to help myself, was removed. The action surprised me,
and I looked for a moment at the mother, who had
withdrawn the dainties so unexpectedly. She looked
at me, slightly ruffled. But no <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">krentebroodjes</span>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wil mijnheer een broodje met vleesch?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh dank U wel</span>,&rdquo; I said, endeavouring to be
quicker. That time I nearly had a slice. But the
agile youth, <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span>, who was in charge of the plate,
whipped it away too.</p>

<p>No <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">broodjes met vleesch</span> for me! It was very queer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Soms een ei?</span>&rdquo; said the dignified grandmother,
in a white cap with gold ornaments. She presided,
and did a great deal of the talking; and I could make
out that she was the widow of a fisherman or
shipowner in a small way, and had once visited
Hull. In virtue of having spent a week there, some
forty years before, she was regarded evidently by
all the rest as an authority on English manners
and customs and language and literature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Soms een ei?</span>&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Engelshman like
egg.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Very much, indeed, I thought, if I could only get
one&mdash;call me English or Irish or whatever you like.
Fain would I have had an egg off that plate, where
she had just put down six or eight, freshly boiled.</p>

<p>Determined to get one, if politeness would assist
me, I smiled and bowed and smiled again. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh, ik
dank U duizendmaal. Ik bewijs volkomen dankbaarheid.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER CUP.</div>

<p>Stunned apparently by my reply, she hesitated.
To encourage her to extend these edibles a trifle nearer,
I said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Alstublieft. Dank U.</span>&rdquo; But she only sighed,
and laid the plate out of reach, reproachfully.</p>

<p>No eggs!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span>,&rdquo; she whispered to her granddaughter;
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">presenteer de schuimpjes</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span> didn&rsquo;t say a word, but pushed a schaaltje
of these light refreshments towards me.</p>

<p>I did secure two; but in a moment they were
finished. You see, a schuimpje doesn&rsquo;t last very
long, when you are really hungry.</p>

<p>Then the mother complained, courteously, of my
slender appetite: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer wil niets gebruiken.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">O ja</span>,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">integendeel! Heel graag.
Alstublieft.</span>&rdquo; And to show I meant it, I asked for
another cup of tea. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mag ik beleefdelijk vragen om<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
een andere kop?</span>&rdquo; Here I reached cup and saucer
towards them.</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">VOOR DE PRONK.</div>

<p>That certainly created a diversion. They looked
blankly at one another, till the grandmother&mdash;she was
very hearty&mdash;called out with a cheerful laugh, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hé,
ja. Dat&rsquo;s waar ook. De Engelsche koppen zijn groot.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span>,&rdquo; she whispered in an audible aside. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Breng
even een Engelsche kom. Ze staan in de kast.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zie zoo. Mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; she continued to me with a
pleasant smile. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nouw, Mijnheer wil zeker nog wat
thee hebben? Nouw, niet bedanken, hoor.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Oh ja</span>,&rdquo; I replied joyfully, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Schiet op&mdash;Als&rsquo;tublieft&mdash;dank
U. Dank U&mdash;heelemaal!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding the tea-pot poised in her hand, she looked
at me appealingly, but in doubt. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat? heus?</span>&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>What was I to do?</p>

<p>I looked at her quite as appealingly, and replied.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, heus! Wel zeker.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was decisive. No tea!</p>

<p>The cup, however, was planted down in front of me,
upside down. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het is voor de pronk, zeker</span>,&rdquo; said the
grandmother. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Engelsche gewoonte&mdash;zeer net.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But conversation flagged. The silence was painful.
You could have heard a pin drop. My discreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
attempt to ask for something had failed, and I didn&rsquo;t
see exactly how I was to improve upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THINGS ARE DEAR IN HOLLAND.</div>

<p>The mother meantime surveyed my empty plate
and empty cup with distinct disapproval, and put
out a feeler: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer houdt niet van Hollandsche
kost?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hollandsch kost</span>&rsquo;, what things <strong>cost</strong> in Holland&mdash;Dutch
prices, in other words? Well, they are
rather high sometimes. The remark seemed somewhat
irrelevant, but it was talk, and therefore
welcome. Anything to break that oppressive silence.
Eagerly embracing the opportunity of saying something,
I responded with cordiality: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hollandsche
kost? Neen. Ik houd niet erg ervan. Dat kan U
begrijpen. Ze zijn veels te hoog!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This well-meant pleasantry was received with
such evident disfavour that I hastened to explain.
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik bedoel dat vele artikelen zijn kostbaar&mdash;of
kostelijk&mdash;mijns bedunkens&mdash;in Holland&mdash;maar
van onberispelijke smaak.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly any response was made to this.&mdash;The
merest murmur on the part of the grandmother,
that was all. But they all looked at me curiously,
without saying a word.</p>

<p>Frantically I strove to make an observation in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
easy friendly way, but all my Dutch seemed to
have deserted me.&mdash;At least all I judged suitable.</p>

<p>Fragments of conversation did float through my
agonized brain, but none of them was quite what
I needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik graauw, ik kef en kweel</span>&rdquo; was out of the
question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INNOCENT OBSERVATION.</div>

<p>Two proverbs suddenly flashed across my mind,
and I gripped them firmly. One was: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Een vogel in de
hand is meer waard dan tien in de lucht</span>,&rdquo; and the tempting
parallel offered itself: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Eén broodje in de hand
is meer waard dan tien op een bord.</span>&rdquo; As this aphorism,
however, didn&rsquo;t sound extra civil, I let it pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Deugd en belooning gaan zelden te samen</span>&rdquo; was the
second proverb; and on that model I managed, after
due cogitation, to construct a nice harmless phrase.
As it expressed what we all knew and could see
before our eyes, I felt safe against contradiction, and
I knew it couldn&rsquo;t hurt anybody. This dictum ran:
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Koek en boterham gaan dikwijls te samen.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was owing to the suddenness with
which I proclaimed this truth, or to some severity
in my manner; but the effect produced on the
company was magical.</p>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span> dropped his fork with a clatter and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst!</span>&rdquo; The mother put her hand to her chest,
whispering. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Zoo&rsquo;n schrik!</span>&rdquo; All looked startled
and stopped eating!</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">HALF-ELF.</div>

<p>To divert the scrutiny of so many eyes, I manufactured
talk on the first thing that occurred to me,
and, reverting to the Dutch prices, said: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Sommige
artikelen in Holland zijn duur. Van morgen heb
ik een plaat bezichtigd&mdash;een poes opgerold over
een kannetje melk&mdash;de zee in de verte. Prachtig.
Maar peper-duur. Tien gulden en een half.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat zegt mijnheer</span>,&rdquo; asked the grandmother,
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">van de poes en de peper en de tien gulden?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assuring her it was merely a &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">plaat</span>&rsquo;, but one that
was &lsquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">erg kostbaar</span>&rsquo;, I grasped at the analogy of
the hours of the day, to do full justice to the expensiveness
of the picture. If ten o&rsquo;clock and a
half works out at &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">half-elf-uur</span>,&rdquo; it is not hard
to reckon what ten guilders-and-a-half <em>ought</em> to
be; so I gave it with relish: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">En, Juffrouw, wat
denkt U? Het kost half-elf-gulden!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jaap looked at his watch and shook his head.
Then he shook the watch, put it back in his pocket
and fastened his eyes again on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee, hoor!</span>&rdquo; exclaimed the mother, who had now
begun to help a special dish; &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nee; zoo laat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
het niet. Mijnheer O&rsquo;Neill, neem een stukje pudding&mdash;toe
dan&mdash;heel verteerbaar.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">STARVATION IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY.</div>

<p>My plate was passed along, and was heaped up
liberally. Though I waited with my thanks as long
as I could, I was obliged to intervene when the plate
was piled high enough for any two people. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nouw,
ik bedank!</span>&rdquo; I ejaculated, making my best bow.</p>

<p>But that caused the guillotine to fall once more.
With a gesture of impatience <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span> put away
my <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">verteerbaar pudding</span> on a remote side-table.
Not the least chance of getting it!</p>

<p>I was starving in the midst of plenty!</p>

<p>As my hosts appeared to be as much impressed
with the contrast as I was, I endeavoured to smooth
things over a little, and set them more at their ease.
Making the best of it, with all the careless grace I
could muster I blandly assured them that it didn&rsquo;t
matter. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het geeft niets&mdash;het hindert niet&mdash;het
komt er niet opaan.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they grew huffy and distant&mdash;my
phrases didn&rsquo;t do much to relieve the strain&mdash;and
I was feeling more depressed and famished
every minute, when, to my unspeakable relief,
up there came the sound of wheels on the gravel,
and in a moment I heard Enderby&rsquo;s voice talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Dutch loudly and confidently in the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">MOHAMMEDAN</span>.</div>

<p>The young folks all rushed out to meet him (he is
a prime favourite with them) and there was much
whispering and laughing and a long confabulation
before they came back.</p>

<p>Enderby entered, and greeted the older people
merrily: but there was a quizzical frown upon
his brow as he sat down near me. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all
this O&rsquo;Neill?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as well as could be expected in the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Circumstances! Why you wouldn&rsquo;t touch the
good food they gave you. Not content with despising
their cookery you objected to their tea-cups, and pretend
that religious scruples keep you from eating until
after half-past ten. They think you are some kind of
<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mohammedan</span>. These kind people are a little hurt, I
fear; and I can see they are greatly astonished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I! I have been as polite as anything, all the
time; but though they offer me plenty of everything,
if I attempt to help myself, whew!&mdash;they whisk the
dish away. They may be hurt, as you say; but I can
tell you, <em>I&rsquo;m starving</em>. Is there no way to&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our conversation was interrupted by the mother&rsquo;s
voice, which broke in with the cheery question:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer Enderby houdt <strong>wel</strong> van Hollandsche
kost, niet waar?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">PROBEER NOUW IS.</div>

<p>I watched what he would say.</p>

<p>He used two easy words: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Dat spreekt.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Busying herself with plates and spoons, the mother
continued: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">U neemt een beetje avondeten?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nouw! Of ik!</span>&rdquo; said Enderby with enthusiasm&mdash;and
they brought him eatables all sorts.</p>

<p>These dainties caught my eye in spite of myself;
and I wondered why none had been given to me. It
was now going on to ten; and I had had nothing since
early breakfast, except a glass of lemonade, a cup of
tea and two small <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schuimpjes</span>.</p>

<p>The old lady was observant, and must have detected
famine in my eye, for with a glance at the clock she
called softly to <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span>: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Probeer nouw is.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>To me she said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wil Mijnheer nog thee?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The secret was mine now, and I didn&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of ik!</span>&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPEN SESAME.</div>

<p>There was a scream of delight from all quarters!
My <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kom</span> was turned right-side up and filled to the
brim with fresh warm tea. I was the centre of
interest at once. Cupboards flew open on all sides,
like pistol-shots, and everybody was waiting to
help me. It was who would give me most.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ham en een broodje?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of ik!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Rookvleesch&mdash;en een ei?</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of ik!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seven lean years were past, now the time
of plenty was come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bitterkoekjes en leverworst?</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Muisjes en
karnemelk?</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Appelbolletjes, wentelteefjes en
molsla?</span>&rdquo;&mdash;I refused nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of ik</span>&rdquo; was the &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo;&mdash;the key
to unlock all cupboards and all hearts.</p>

<p>I took care to thank nobody for anything, for
fear my plate would be removed. Happy laughter
was heard on all sides. Smiles beamed on every
face. In an instant I had become the most popular
man on the island,&mdash;at all events with the people
in that farm-house. Their hospitality and my hunger
had met at last, and come to terms&mdash;to the
unbounded enthusiasm of all.</p>

<p>Meantime Enderby had communicated to them
the fact that I was an Irishman; and I overheard
someone venture on the singular criticism: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">De
Ieren zijn zoo lief voor elkaar! Hij gebruikt niets
als zijn vriend er niet bij is.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Hé, wat lief!</span>&rdquo; said <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Baas Willemse</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Innig!</span>&rdquo; whispered the grandmother, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Leuk</span>&rdquo;, answered the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Aardig</span>&rdquo;, said some one else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Typisch</span>&rdquo;, exclaimed Truitje.</p>

<p>A grumble fell on our ears: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat gek!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AFFECTIONATE IRISH TERRIER.</div>

<p><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Truitje</span> talked on one side of Enderby; <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span>
talked on the other. Enderby smiled, then sniggered,
then laughed; and finally, laying down his
knife and fork, he looked at me, and leaned back
in his chair and positively roared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked austerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says it&rsquo;s touching to see your affection for
me. You looked so melancholy when I was away, as
if you were longing for something&mdash;or crossed in
love&mdash;or disappointed! You&rsquo;ve won their hearts,
at last, my boy, not a doubt of it. Still, don&rsquo;t
overdo that phrase, now that you&rsquo;ve got it. <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span>
here has a story about an Irish terrier in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Drenthe</span>
that refused to eat anything for three days, when
its master was away in <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdam</span>. But he adds
that the terrier made up for it, by eating everything
it could, when its master came back. I
can see that you are going to achieve a reputation
that will outrival that of your canine compatriot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
unless you have a care. Be a bit cautious, please.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL PRINCIPLES.</div>

<p>Here <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span>, dimly apprehending that Enderby
was speaking about him, performed a mystic rite
that puzzled me extremely.</p>

<p>Pretending to sharpen an imaginary pencil on his
forefinger he held it towards us and cried, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Sliep uit.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is that?&rdquo; I asked Enderby&mdash;who,
however, could only tell me that it was intended
as a roguish taunt&mdash;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap</span> was always a schelm&mdash;but
the phrase was otherwise meaningless.</p>

<p>As such I jotted it down at once in my notebook
for future use.</p>

<p>From these experiences in the boerderij I was
able to deduce an important general principle of
practical value.</p>

<p><strong>If you want anything in Holland never
say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, until the object is firmly
in your grasp.</strong> Then you may be as civil
as you like. But before you get hold of it, you
are only safe if you say, &ldquo;If I&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>In the Dutch language premature thanks
are equivalent to a refusal; so you&rsquo;d better
keep your gratitude out of sight.</strong></p>

<p>Well, I had won all hearts here in virtue of
my discoveries. As we were going away the grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
gave me a second Good-bye, shaking me
warmly by both hands. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Heeft mijnheer zich goed
geamuseerd?</span>&rdquo; she enquired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PARTING SALVO.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kostelijk&mdash;Uitstekend&mdash;Nouw!</span>&rdquo; was my
prompt reply, for I had expected that query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Wat spreekt mijnheer nouw makkelijk Hollandsch!</span>&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Gunst, ja</span>&rdquo;, was my retort. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik heb zoo&rsquo;n pret
gehad! Onbetaalbaar!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I caught <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jaap&rsquo;s</span> eye; it was critical; so to pay
back the youth for his terrier-story I took out my
pencil, sharpened it in full view of them all and
said, &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Sliep uit, Jaap; je bent een schelm</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With that they all cheered, young and old,
saying &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Net, Mijnheer, net!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Tot weerziens!</span>&rdquo; laughed the grandmother shaking
hands again. &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kom spoedig terug</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja hoor; dat spreekt.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Belooft u?</span>&rdquo; she repeated, before she let me go.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, and gave a parting
salvo: &ldquo;<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ja, zeker&mdash;Stellig&mdash;Och kom!&mdash;Reken
er op!&mdash;Of ik!!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We drove away in a perfect tornado of applause.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE.</h2>


<p>On reaching my rooms at<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl"> Ferdinand Bolstraat</span> 66<i>a</i>,
the landlady greeted me with respectful effusion
and told me that <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Jan</span> was as good as cured, though the
wounded arm would remain stiff for a good while, she
feared. She was loud in the praises of the <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Engelsche
juffrouw</span> and her profisciency in Dutch; and (sinking
her voice confidentially) <span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Mijnheer van Leeuwen</span> had
left a letter for me upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boyton&rdquo;, I thought, as I climbed those forty nine
precipitous steps that led to my room, &ldquo;I hope you
have done your duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he had.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EXPECTED SURPRISE.</div>

<p>Van Leeuwen wrote that he would prepare me for
a great surprise! It was yet a profound secret; but,&mdash;well,
in fact&mdash;that is to say&mdash;he was engaged
to my cousin Kathleen. They had discovered mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sympathies and affinities over the study of Dutch&mdash;to
which language now my cousin was devoting her
serious attention. By the by they had been delighted
with that monograph of mine. And the queer Grammar
was useful. (I should think so!)</p>

<p>He said that he could well imagine my astonished
looks when I got this news about his attachment!
Now confess, he concluded, that you hadn&rsquo;t the ghost
of a suspicion as to what was coming?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh hadn&rsquo;t I just?&rdquo; I soliloquized, &ldquo;Well; there&rsquo;s
only one thing, my dear fellow, to say to all that;
And I really must say it in Dutch: <span class="g" lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Of ik</span>?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
